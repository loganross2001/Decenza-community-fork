"""Apply qmllint's own suggested scope prefixes to unqualified accesses.

WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT DOES NOT GUESS
------------------------------------------
Qualifying an identifier means deciding WHICH scope it belongs to. Reading indentation to
decide is how you get this, from a real bulk pass:

    ValueInput.qml has `gear` on a delegate. The pass prefixed it with the component root,
    which has no such member, so every gear tap assigned `undefined`.

qmllint already knows the answer and prints it. For an unqualified access it emits (this is real
output from the PATCHED qmllint, taken AFTER the delegate gained `required property var modelData`
— that matters: against an injected context property qmllint offers no id at all, because there is
no id to offer. The suggestion appears once the role is a declared member of a delegate with an id):

    Warning: .../FlushPage.qml:142:35: Unqualified access [unqualified]
                                text: modelData.name
                                      ^^^^^^^^^
    Info: modelData is a member of a parent element.
          You can qualify the access with its id to avoid this warning.

                                text: livePresetDelegate.modelData.name
                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

That last block is the corrected line, with the RIGHT id — `livePresetDelegate`, not the page
root, and not the other delegate in the same file. This script reads that suggestion and applies
it. It never infers a prefix.

THE OTHER RULE: INSERT RIGHT-TO-LEFT
------------------------------------
Two insertions on one line, applied left-to-right, put the second one in the wrong place because
the first shifted every column after it. That is how `results.length` became
`results.shotHistoryPage.length` — undefined, `+=` made it NaN, and Shot History pagination died.
qmllint did not catch it: `results` is a signal-handler parameter typed `var`, so nothing checks
that chain. Sorting by descending column is the whole fix, and --verify re-checks it anyway.

WHAT IT DOES NOT HANDLE
-----------------------
Sites with no suggestion are reported, never guessed at. In practice they are:
  * bare calls to the file's own functions — qmllint says "Unqualified access" with no Info block
  * `event` in a `Keys.onXPressed: { ... }` handler — Info says `"event" is ambiguous. Use a
    function instead: (event) => ...`, and the fix is the `function(event)` form, not a prefix
  * ids from outer components inside a nested component — Info says to set
    `pragma ComponentBehavior: Bound`, which is a semantic change and needs a delegate audit first

It DOES now handle qmllint's glued-diagnostic bug (see GLUED_RE) — that one used to lose sites
silently rather than report them, which is the worst possible behaviour for a tool whose entire
claim is "never guesses". An accounting check in main() refuses to edit if the parsed count and
qmllint's own count for the file disagree, so a future format change fails loudly instead.
