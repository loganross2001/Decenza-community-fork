    // 15-iteration one measured **1015 ms**, settling completed by timer, and the test
    // failed on an unrelated final-weight assertion that said nothing about why. That

    // Looping on the CONDITION instead spends the minimum wall time, so it cannot
    // overshoot by feeding samples nobody needs. The isSawSettling() check is the point of
    // the helper: if the ceiling is hit anyway, the failure says so instead of surfacing
    // as a wrong final weight three assertions later.

    // TIMING, derived from the constants rather than guessed. The window fills on the 6th
    // sample (SETTLING_WINDOW_SIZE = 6), which is when the stability clock STARTS; the gate
    // then needs SETTLING_CLEAN_CAPTURE_MS (250 ms) more, i.e. 5 further samples at 50 ms.
    // So capture lands on roughly the 11th sample, ~500 ms — against a 1000 ms ceiling.
    // An earlier version of this comment said "around sample 7, ~350 ms", which was wrong
    // in the direction that matters: it made the margin look twice as large as it is.
    //
    // Hence the cap of 16 rather than 20. Twenty iterations is 1000 ms, exactly
    // SETTLING_STABLE_MS — a bound sitting precisely on the threshold it exists to stay
