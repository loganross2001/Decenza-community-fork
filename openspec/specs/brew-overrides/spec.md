# brew-overrides Specification

## Purpose
Defines the persistent per-brew overrides (temperature, dose, ratio, yield, grind) set via the BrewDialog: temperature is stored and applied as a delta relative to the profile's `espressoTemperature` anchor, identically across the live-brew upload and "Update Profile" save paths; overrides survive app restart, are shown in the shot plan display, and are recorded to and retrievable from shot history.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Persistent Brew Overrides

Temperature overrides SHALL be applied as a delta offset relative to the profile's reference temperature, defined as the profile scalar `espressoTemperature`. The delta is computed as `override - espressoTemperature` and added to each frame's individual temperature, preserving relative temperature differences between frames. The same anchor (`espressoTemperature`) SHALL be used by every path that applies a temperature override as a delta — both the live-brew upload path and the Brew Dialog "Update Profile" (save-to-profile) path — so that a given override value produces an identical result whether it is brewed or saved.

**Storage:** Temperature overrides are persistent (stored in QSettings) and survive app restarts. They are stored in shot history as dedicated `temperature_override` database columns.

#### Scenario: User sets temperature override with multi-temp profile
- **WHEN** the profile has frames with temperatures [93, 93, 88, 88] (espressoTemperature = 93)
- **AND** the user sets a brew temperature of 95°C in the BrewDialog
- **THEN** the delta is +2°C (95 - 93)
- **AND** the uploaded profile frames have temperatures [95, 95, 90, 90]
- **AND** the shot plan displays the override using the adaptive multi-temperature notation (see Shot Plan Display)

#### Scenario: User sets temperature override lower than profile default
- **WHEN** the profile has frames with temperatures [90, 90, 85] (espressoTemperature = 90)
- **AND** the user sets a brew temperature of 88°C in the BrewDialog
- **THEN** the delta is -2°C (88 - 90)
- **AND** the uploaded profile frames have temperatures [88, 88, 83]

#### Scenario: Live-brew and save paths use the same anchor
- **WHEN** a profile's `espressoTemperature` differs from its first frame temperature
- **AND** the user sets a brew temperature override of T°C
- **THEN** the delta applied by the live-brew upload path equals the delta applied by the "Update Profile" save path (both computed as `T - espressoTemperature`)
- **AND** the temperatures previewed in the Brew Dialog match the temperatures that are brewed and the temperatures that are saved

### Requirement: Brew Dialog
The system SHALL provide a BrewDialog accessible from the shot plan line on IdlePage and from the StatusBar. The dialog SHALL display the current profile name and bean info as a "Base Recipe" header, and allow editing temperature, dose, ratio, yield and grind (in this order) for the next shot. The temperature control SHALL be presented as a temperature **offset** (labeled "Temp Delta:") applied uniformly to the whole profile: it reads `0°` at the profile default and `+N°`/`-N°` when adjusted. Because the control no longer shows an absolute temperature, the dialog SHALL display the profile's actual temperature(s) below it, rendered adaptively (single value / spaced mid-dot list / first…last ellipsis), so the user can see what the offset is applied to.

#### Scenario: Opening the BrewDialog
- **WHEN** the user taps the shot plan text on IdlePage
- **THEN** the BrewDialog opens with current values populated from Settings (DYE metadata and profile defaults)
- **AND** the targetWeight and targetTemperature are set with a precedence order: overrides first, then profile defaults

#### Scenario: Temperature offset control
- **WHEN** the BrewDialog opens with no temperature override active
- **THEN** the "Temp Delta:" control reads `0°`
- **AND** the profile's actual temperature(s) are shown below it using the adaptive notation: a single value for a one-temperature profile, a spaced mid-dot list for two distinct temperatures (e.g. "Profile: 90 · 88°C"), or first-step…last-step ellipsis for three or more
- **WHEN** the user adjusts the control to `+2°`
- **THEN** every frame's temperature is raised by 2°C for the next shot (the profile structure shown below is unchanged)
- **AND** a "Update Profile" action permanently bakes the `+2°` offset into every frame

#### Scenario: Dose from scale
- **WHEN** the user taps "Get from scale" in the BrewDialog
- **AND** the scale reports weight ≥ 3g
- **THEN** the dose value is updated to the scale reading
- **WHEN** the scale reports weight < 3g
- **THEN** a warning is shown asking the user to place the portafilter on the scale

#### Scenario: Ratio and yield auto-calculation
- **WHEN** the user changes dose or ratio
- **THEN** yield is recalculated automatically (dose × ratio)
- **WHEN** the user manually edits the yield value
- **THEN** the ratio is changed automatically (yield / dose)

#### Scenario: Clear all overrides
- **WHEN** the user taps the "Clear" button in the BrewDialog
- **THEN** all fields reset to profile defaults (temperature) and empty/default values (dose=18g, grind=bean"", ratio=calculated from profiel target weight / 18g)

### Requirement: Shot Plan Display
The system SHALL display a summary line showing the configured shot parameters: profile name with temperature, bean name with grind setting, and dose/yield weights. The line SHALL be clickable to open the BrewDialog. Visibility SHALL be controlled by a "Show shot plan" setting (default: enabled). When a "Show on all screens" setting is enabled, the shot plan line SHALL appear in the top status bar on all pages; otherwise it SHALL appear only on the IdlePage.

The temperature portion SHALL render the profile's own temperature(s) adaptively based on the number of distinct frame temperatures (N), so that multi-temperature profiles are not misrepresented as a single value:
- **N = 1:** a single value (e.g. `90°C`).
- **N = 2:** both distinct temperatures listed with a spaced mid-dot separator (e.g. `88 · 93°C`).
- **N ≥ 3:** the first-step temperature and last-step temperature joined by an ellipsis, preserving trajectory order rather than sorting (e.g. `84…52°C`).

When a temperature override is active, the profile's temperatures SHALL still be shown (unshifted) followed by a signed delta tag expressing the offset applied to every step (e.g. `90°C +1°`, `88 · 93°C +2°`, `84…52°C -1°`). The override SHALL NOT be rendered as a recomputed single temperature or a from→to arrow. Multi-temperature profiles (N ≥ 2) SHALL render with the list/ellipsis notation even when no override is active.

#### Scenario: Shot plan with single-temperature profile, no overrides
- **WHEN** no overrides are active, the profile has one distinct frame temperature, and DYE metadata is populated
- **THEN** the shot plan shows: "ProfileName (88°C) · BeanName (grind) · 18.0g in, 36.0g out"

#### Scenario: Shot plan with single-temperature profile and temperature override
- **WHEN** a temperature override of +2°C is active and the profile has one distinct frame temperature of 88°C
- **THEN** the temperature portion shows the value and offset: "ProfileName (88°C +2°)"

#### Scenario: Shot plan with two distinct temperatures
- **WHEN** the profile has two distinct frame temperatures (e.g. 88 and 93)
- **THEN** with no override the temperature portion shows the mid-dot list: "ProfileName (88 · 93°C)"
- **AND** with a +2° override active it shows the list and offset: "ProfileName (88 · 93°C +2°)"

#### Scenario: Shot plan with three or more distinct temperatures
- **WHEN** the profile has three or more distinct frame temperatures with first-step 84°C and last-step 52°C
- **THEN** with no override the temperature portion shows the ellipsis notation: "ProfileName (84…52°C)"
- **AND** with a +1° override active it shows the ellipsis and offset: "ProfileName (84…52°C +1°)"

#### Scenario: Shot plan hidden when empty
- **WHEN** no profile is loaded and no DYE metadata is set
- **THEN** the shot plan line is not visible

#### Scenario: Shot plan disabled via settings
- **WHEN** the "Show shot plan" setting is disabled
- **THEN** the shot plan line is not visible on any page

#### Scenario: Shot plan on idle page only (default)
- **WHEN** "Show shot plan" is enabled and "Show on all screens" is disabled
- **THEN** the shot plan line appears only on the IdlePage within the page content

#### Scenario: Shot plan on all screens
- **WHEN** "Show shot plan" is enabled and "Show on all screens" is enabled
- **THEN** the shot plan line appears in the top status bar between the page title and the indicators
- **AND** tapping it opens the BrewDialog from any page

### Requirement: Brew Overrides History Recording
The system SHALL record the active brew overrides (temperature, yield) as dedicated database columns in the shot history when a shot is saved. This enables traceability of per-shot adjustments.

#### Scenario: Overrides saved to shot history
- **WHEN** a shot ends with active brew overrides
- **THEN** the temperature override is stored in the `temperature_override` column (NULL if not set)
- **AND** the yield override is stored in the `yield_override` column (NULL if not set)
- **AND** the overrides are available when viewing the shot in history

#### Scenario: No overrides recorded when none active
- **WHEN** a shot ends without any active brew overrides
- **THEN** the `temperature_override` and `yield_override` columns are NULL

### Requirement: Shot History Parameter Retrieval
The system SHALL populate brew parameters (dose, yield, grind) from shot history when a shot is loaded via `loadShotWithMetadata()`. This allows the user to repeat a previous shot's settings. If the shot has recorded brew overrides, those take precedence; otherwise the profile's target weight is used for yield.

#### Scenario: Loading shot with brew overrides from history
- **WHEN** the user loads a shot from history that has override columns populated
- **THEN** the dose override is set from the DYE metadata (shot-specific, not override)
- **AND** the yield override is set from the `yield_override` column if not NULL
- **AND** the temperature override is set from the `temperature_override` column if not NULL
- **AND** the grinder setting is populated from the DYE metadata
- **AND** the BrewDialog shows these as active overrides

#### Scenario: Loading shot without brew overrides from history
- **WHEN** the user loads a shot from history that has NULL override columns
- **THEN** no temperature or yield overrides are set
- **AND** the yield defaults to the loaded profile's target weight
- **AND** the dose defaults to the DYE bean weight (default 18g)

#### Scenario: BrewDialog pre-populated from history
- **WHEN** the BrewDialog opens after loading a shot from history
- **THEN** dose, yield, and grind fields reflect the active overrides (if set) or profile defaults
- **AND** the ratio is calculated from the effective dose and yield

### Requirement: Persistent Override Storage
The system SHALL store temperature and yield overrides in QSettings for persistence across app sessions. "Active" is tracked by a genuine boolean flag (`hasTemperatureOverride`, `hasBrewYieldOverride`) that reflects whether a deliberate override is currently in effect — not merely whether an override value has ever been set during the session. Overrides SHALL be cleared — the flag set false, not just the value resynced to a new default — when switching profiles, when a recipe is activated (before its own overrides apply), or when the user taps "Clear" in the BrewDialog. Loading a shot or favorite that carries its own frozen override value SHALL only mark the flag active when that frozen value genuinely differs from the freshly-loaded profile's own default (the same threshold the Shot Plan display uses), so a frozen value that happens to already match the current profile never falsely reports as an active override.

#### Scenario: Overrides persist between app sessions
- **WHEN** the user sets temperature or yield overrides in the BrewDialog
- **THEN** the values are immediately saved to QSettings
- **AND** when the app is restarted, the overrides are restored from QSettings
- **AND** the overrides remain active until explicitly cleared

#### Scenario: Overrides cleared on profile switch
- **WHEN** the user switches to a different profile
- **THEN** all overrides are cleared from QSettings, and `hasTemperatureOverride`/`hasBrewYieldOverride` become false
- **AND** the IdlePage shot plan returns to profile defaults with no highlight

#### Scenario: Overrides cleared via BrewDialog
- **WHEN** the user taps "Clear" in the BrewDialog
- **THEN** all overrides are removed from QSettings and the override flags become false
- **AND** the Settings properties are reset to default values

#### Scenario: Overrides cleared on recipe activation
- **WHEN** a recipe is activated
- **THEN** the override flags reflect only that recipe's own stored overrides (or false, if it has none) — not a leftover flag from whatever was active before

#### Scenario: Deactivation alone leaves the live setup untouched
- **WHEN** the active recipe is deactivated without switching profile or bag
- **THEN** the live brew values — including any override the recipe applied — remain in effect (deactivation drops the recipe association, not the dialed setup); the next profile or recipe switch clears them as above

#### Scenario: A frozen shot value matching the current profile is not flagged
- **WHEN** a shot or favorite is loaded whose saved `temperatureOverride` happens to equal the freshly-loaded profile's own default temperature
- **THEN** `hasTemperatureOverride` is false and the Shot Plan shows no highlight

### Requirement: Profile Editor Global Temperature Delta
The Profile Editor's global temperature field ("All temps") SHALL apply temperature changes as a delta offset relative to the current first frame temperature, preserving relative differences between frames. The `espressoTemperature` profile-level field SHALL be updated to the new first frame value.

#### Scenario: Changing global temperature with varying frame temps
- **WHEN** the profile has frames with temperatures [93, 93, 88, 88]
- **AND** the user changes the global temperature from 93 to 95
- **THEN** the delta is +2°C
- **AND** the frames become [95, 95, 90, 90]
- **AND** `espressoTemperature` is set to 95

#### Scenario: Changing global temperature with uniform frame temps
- **WHEN** all frames have the same temperature (e.g., [90, 90, 90])
- **AND** the user changes the global temperature to 92
- **THEN** all frames become [92, 92, 92] (delta and absolute produce same result)
