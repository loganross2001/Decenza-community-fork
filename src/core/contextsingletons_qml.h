// QML registration for objects main() owns and used to publish with setContextProperty().
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE CLASS HEADERS
// -----------------------------------------------------
// The obvious move is to put QML_ELEMENT straight in each class header, the way CoffeeBagStorage
// and the types reachable through MainController do it.
//
// THE REASON THIS FILE GIVES FOR NOT DOING THAT IS OUT OF DATE. It used to say the classes here
// are compiled into test and tool targets that link no Qt6::Qml, citing add_decenza_test() as
// linking "Test/Core/Bluetooth/Sql/Network/Gui and nothing else". That is false: decenza_testlib
// links Qt6::Qml PUBLIC (tests/CMakeLists.txt, since #1617) and every add_decenza_test() target
// links decenza_testlib, so they all get it transitively — de1device.cpp, this file's headline
// example, is compiled straight into decenza_testlib. The four targets that genuinely lack
// Qt6::Qml (profile_sync, shot_eval, saw_replay, saw_parity) compile none of these classes.
//
// So the link-time argument does not currently justify the indirection. What may still justify it
// is narrower and UNMEASURED: keeping <QtQml/...> out of class headers that much of the app
// includes, so adding or changing a registration does not invalidate every TU that includes them.
// Nobody has measured that, so do not repeat it as the reason either. What IS true and worth
// keeping: this file compiles only into the Decenza target, so whatever it includes stops here.
//
// Only the Decenza target compiles this file (CMakeLists.txt), so the QtQml dependency stops
// here no matter how widely the underlying headers are included.
//
// WHY SINGLETONS RATHER THAN CONTEXT PROPERTIES
// ---------------------------------------------
// A context property is invisible to qmllint, qmlcachegen and the language server: the name
// resolves at runtime and at no other time. Every QML reference to one counts as an unqualified
// access — and, worse, is indistinguishable from a typo, because nothing in the build can tell
// the two apart. #1661 is what that costs when it goes wrong.
//
// The 30 context properties live when this file was created accounted for 943 such warnings. The
// names registered BELOW are now ALL 943 — 660 in the first batch (#1680), plus
// SteamHealthTracker, FlowCalibrationModel, ProfileStorage and McpServer, plus USBManager and
// UsbScaleManager (everywhere but iOS — see below), and finally GHCSimulator, ScaleDevice and
// Refractometer. The figure is unchanged by the iOS exclusion, because the gate that counts runs
// on Linux, where both are registered. Update this figure
// when you add an entry; it is the one number in this file that goes stale silently.
//
// NONE remain. `setContextProperty()` has no live call in main.cpp. The three that were listed
// here as remaining — ScaleDevice and Refractometer (re-pointed at runtime) and GHCSimulator
// (declared after the engine) — all landed; see openspec/changes/fix-qmllint-usability/tasks.md
// §4 and the LIFETIME note below for how each obstacle was actually removed.
//
// "Inside `#ifndef Q_OS_IOS`" used to be listed here as a blocker for USBManager and
// UsbScaleManager, and it is still one — for the TYPE. On iOS these two are not registered at all,
// because naming them means including headers that include <QSerialPort>, which that platform does
// not build or link. What #1687 did remove is the blocker for a name whose INSTANCE is optional;
// that is decenzaOptionalSingleton() below, and GHCSimulator is what it covers. See the note above
// USBManagerForeign.
// "Types already registered uncreatable in their own headers"
// was listed as a blocker too — that one was simply wrong. Only SteamHealthTracker was ever in
// that shape, and the registration just moved here.
//
// LIFETIME — READ BEFORE ADDING AN ENTRY
// --------------------------------------
// Every object registered here MUST be declared before `QQmlApplicationEngine engine`
// (src/main.cpp) so it is destroyed after it. This is not a stylistic preference. A context
// property is dropped by QML when its object emits destroyed(), so publishing a short-lived
// object that way is survivable; a singleton published through a static raw pointer has no such
// mechanism, and nothing nulls it. main.cpp's teardown comment records a refractometer crash
// from exactly this ordering — the object died first while live bindings were still reading it.
//
// So: hoist the declaration first, then register. flowCalibrationModel was hoisted for exactly
// that reason and is registered below; de1SimulatorPtr is still declared after `engine` and is
// deliberately NOT here.
//
// ghcSimulator IS here now, and the hoist is what made it possible. It used to be declared in
// main.cpp after `QQmlApplicationEngine engine`, so registering it as-is would have published a
// raw pointer to an object that dies while live bindings can still read it — the refractometer
// crash, again. The declaration moved above the engine first; only then was it registered. Same
// for scaleProxy and refractometerProxy. Do the hoist, then register; do not register without
// the hoist.

// The same publish, for a name whose instance legitimately does not exist on some builds.
//
// decenzaPublishedSingleton() treats a null instance as always a defect, which is right for a
// name main() unconditionally owns and wrong for one whose object is optional on a build that does
// register the type — a qCritical on every launch would be noise reporting the intended state.
//
// GHCSimulator is the only caller. USBManager and UsbScaleManager were the original two and are
// not any more: their registration and their publish are now behind the SAME `#ifndef Q_OS_IOS`,
// so there is no build where the type exists and the instance does not, and a null there would be
// a real publish-order defect that this quiet form would hide. They use the loud form.
//
// CRITICAL, AND NOT WHAT THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY: a null instance does NOT make the name read as
// `undefined` in QML. It used to claim that, and every `typeof X !== "undefined"` guard written
// against this class was relying on it. The Qt 6.11.1 sources say otherwise:
//
//   - qv4qmlcontext.cpp:229 resolves a singleton NAME with `QQmlTypeWrapper::create(v4, nullptr,
//     r.type)`. It calls singletonInstance<QObject*>() and DISCARDS the result — the wrapper is
//     built whether or not there is an instance.
//   - QQmlTypeWrapper has no virtualToBoolean override, so that wrapper is a truthy Object and
//     `typeof` on it is "object".
//   - Only the MEMBER READ degrades: qqmltypewrapper.cpp:319 fails its
//     `if (QObject *qobjectSingleton = ...)` and falls through to Object::virtualGet, giving
//     `undefined`.
//
// So on a build where the TYPE is registered but the INSTANCE is not, `typeof X !== "undefined"`
// and `if (X)` both PASS, and the first method call throws
// `TypeError: Property '...' of object [object Object] is not a function`.
//
// Guard the MEMBER, never the name — for THIS case, which is: the type is registered on the build
// and the instance may be missing.
//
//     if (X.doThing !== undefined) X.doThing()        // correct
//     if (typeof X !== "undefined" && X) X.doThing()  // passes, then throws
//
// The other case is the opposite and needs the opposite guard: a type NOT registered on the build
// at all (USBManager and UsbScaleManager on iOS). The name then resolves to nothing, and
// qv4qmlcontext.cpp:552-553 ends the lookup with `engine->throwReferenceError(name->toQString())`
// — so the bare `X` in `X.doThing !== undefined` throws before the member is reached. Guard the
// PLATFORM there. (`typeof X` happens to be honest in this case: Runtime::TypeofName::call clears
// the exception on purpose, qv4runtime.cpp:1746-1754, "typeof doesn't throw". Do not rely on that
// asymmetry — one idiom that is right in both cases is the platform check.)
//
// A platform check (`Qt.platform.os !== "ios"`) is also fine, because it short-circuits before the
// member read — that is why the USB pair's call sites were never affected by this.
//
// The real difference from a context property is that the name is now a declared type: qmllint
// checks the member you reach for, and a typo in it fails even though the instance may be absent
// at runtime.
//
// Do NOT reach for this to silence a name that should always be present. The loud version is the
// default for a reason — an unpublished mandatory singleton reads as "every binding is undefined"
// with nothing saying why.
