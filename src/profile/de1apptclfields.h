// This exists so that Profile::loadFromTclString() and the drift gate in
// tools/profile_sync resolve the SAME .tcl key for the same canonical field.
// The two disagreeing is not hypothetical: a comparison written against the
// wrong spelling once inflated the built-in drift list from 4 rows to 60 and
