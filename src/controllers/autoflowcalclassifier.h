/**
 * Checks whether a flow-controlled window's measured mean machine flow fell
 * meaningfully short of the touched frame's target flow.
 *
 * Rationale: a flow-controlled frame can carry a pressure ceiling (e.g.
 * D-Flow, D-Flow/Q). When the puck's resistance would require exceeding that
 * ceiling to hold the frame's target flow, the DE1 caps pressure instead and
 * flow falls below target for the rest of the frame. Assuming the target was
 * achieved is what `computeAutoFlowCalibration()`'s flow-branch formula does
 * (`weightFlow / (targetFlow * density)`) — dividing by an unattained target
 * manufactures an ideal that measures nothing about sensor accuracy
 * (Kulitorum/Decenza#1823). A caller should treat a window where
 * `missedTarget` is true as pressure-controlled for formula-selection
 * purposes: reuse the achieved-flow (pressure-branch) formula and its ratio
 * guard, which already correctly handle "pump was constrained below its
 * setpoint" regardless of which setpoint did the constraining.
 *
 * Deliberately ONE-SIDED: only undershoot (`meanMachineFlow < targetFlow`)
 * can set `missedTarget`, never overshoot. A pressure ceiling can hold flow
 * BELOW its setpoint; it has no mechanism to push flow above it, so an
 * overshoot reading has no pressure-cap explanation. Reclassifying an
 * overshooting-but-still-genuinely-flow-controlled window would route it
 * through the pressure-branch formula's reported-flow denominator on a
 * window that may still be PID-locked to target — exactly the feedback-loop
 * bug (factor drifts down and can never converge) that using TARGET flow for
 * flow-controlled windows was introduced to avoid in the first place; see
 * the "v3 Migration" section of `docs/CLAUDE_MD/AUTO_FLOW_CALIBRATION.md`.
 *
 * @param meanMachineFlow   Mean reported flow during the window (mL/s).
 * @param targetFlow        The touched frame's target flow (mL/s). Must be > 0;
 *                          returns `{false, 0.0}` for a non-positive target
 *                          (nothing to compare against).
 * @param thresholdFraction Relative undershoot above which the window is
 *                          considered pressure-capped (e.g. 0.10 for 10%).
