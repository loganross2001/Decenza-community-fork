# Design — Tap-only taste intake

## Problem framing

The advisor's advice keys on taste, but taste is the one shot attribute the curve
can't reveal. The dial-in reference tables (`espresso_dial_in_reference.md`) map
taste directly onto machine changes:

- **Sour ↔ Bitter** → extraction axis → grind / temperature / time.
- **Thin ↔ Strong** → concentration axis → ratio / dose / preinfusion.

So the highest-value-per-tap signals are exactly those two axes plus an overall
score. We harvest what the AI can't measure; we do **not** ask for anything the
curve already tells it (duration, ratio, channeling, etc.).

## Key decisions

### 1. Tap-only gate — no text in the picker

The picker is presented on opening the advisor and is **entirely tap-driven**.
There is deliberately no note field. Rationale:

- The value proposition is "get better advice without typing." A text box
  reintroduces the keyboard — and the keyboard is exactly what has caused this
  overlay's recurring render/scroll bugs (#920, #608, #470, #767). Keeping the
  picker text-free keeps it clear of that entire bug class.
- Users who want to type already have the normal compose box; Skip drops them
  there in one tap.

### 2. Gate on "is there something to return to?", not a seen-flag

The intake shows unless the shot already has a **saved conversation**
(`conversation.hasHistory`) **or** saved taste feedback (any of `taste_balance` /
`taste_body` / `enjoyment0to100`). An earlier design used a per-shot "seen" flag
set when the intake was *shown* — but that suppressed it after a user opened,
backed out without asking, and returned (the conversation was still empty and no
feedback existed, yet the intake never came back). Gating on emptiness fixes that:
new / cleared / backed-out sessions re-show the intake; asking the AI or recording
any taste sends the user straight to the text conversation thereafter. This also
removes the unbounded per-shot QSettings keys the flag would have accrued.

Because the gate requires *no* saved feedback, all three rows are always unset
when the intake is shown (no partial/adaptive-row case to handle).

### 3. Structured columns, not free-text

Taste could have been encoded into the existing `espressoNotes` free-text field
(cheaper, no migration). It is stored as structured columns instead because
several consumers must reliably answer "is taste set, and to what?": the intake
gate reads saved-feedback to decide whether to show (decision 2), the Visualizer
CVA mapping keys off the exact value, and the review-page picker pre-selects a
prior value — all trivial against a column with an empty sentinel and unreliable
against prose. Free-text would also be a **second, informal** representation of a
concept that already has a structured widget (the rating slider), i.e. the
parallel-interface trap. The double-win (dial-in history, SAW context, "last time
you said sour you went finer") also needs queryable columns.

Bar applied (drawn from why `remove-inferred-shot-ratings` failed): *add a shots
column only if the signal can't be gotten another way AND changes the AI's
advice.*

- **Taste (sour/bitter): passes cleanly** — uninferable from the curve, decision-
  changing, only otherwise captured reactively-if-typed.
- **Body: passes on the AI axis weakly** (partly inferable from ratio/flow), but
  earns its place on a second ground: **body/mouthfeel is a real SCA CVA attribute
  and a real Visualizer column**, so it maps 1:1 on upload (see decision 7). That
  clean round-trip is why the middle row is **Body (Thin/Medium/Heavy)** and not
  "Strength (Weak/Strong)" — strength has no CVA field and would not round-trip.

### 4. Overall reuses `RatingInput` + `enjoyment0to100`

No new rating widget. `RatingInput.qml` is already shared (review page +
Visualizer settings). This is the survivor of `shot-rating-capture`: Layer 3
(inferred auto-rating) was removed for overwriting the user's Visualizer default
and giving the model nothing; the `QuickRatingRow` (Layer 2) was a *parallel*
rating widget that drifted and was consolidated back into the slider (#1243/#1245).
Both outcomes argue for reusing the one canonical rating control — which we do.

### 5. Layer-1 handoff is emergent, not coded

`maybePersistRatingFromReply` fires only when the prior assistant turn asked about
taste (marker list in `aimanager.cpp`) and the reply parses as a rating. The
advisor asks only because the system prompt tells it to when taste feedback is
absent. Therefore:

```
 fill  → composed "…tasted sour…" sentence + rendered fields in the first prompt
         → advisor has taste → never asks → Layer 1 stays dormant
 skip  → no taste in prompt → advisor asks (today) → user types → Layer 1 catches
```

No suppression flag is needed. The only wiring required is extending the
"has taste feedback" signal so a set `taste_balance`/`taste_body` counts as
feedback even when Overall is left unrated — otherwise the advisor could still ask
despite a tapped taste chip.

### 6. Setting defaults ON, in `SettingsAI`

`Settings.ai.tasteIntakeOnAsk`, default `true`. OFF restores today's
open-straight-to-compose behavior, so no existing workflow regresses. It lives in
the `SettingsAI` domain sub-object per the settings-split rules; `SettingsAI`
already exists, so no new `qmlRegisterUncreatableType` is required.

### 7. Visualizer CVA mapping — coarse but honest

Visualizer adopted the SCA **CVA Descriptive Assessment** (March 2026): 8
attributes, each `0–15` intensity, writable via the same `PATCH /shots/{id}` /
`POST /shots/upload` body `visualizeruploader.cpp` already sends, and editable in
Visualizer's `_tasting_assessment` web form. The tap enums map up:

```
  sour     → acidity 12, bitterness 4      thin   → mouthfeel 4
  balanced → acidity 8,  bitterness 8      medium → mouthfeel 8
  bitter   → acidity 4,  bitterness 12     heavy  → mouthfeel 12
  overall  → espresso_enjoyment (0–100, already mapped)
```

Two honesty guardrails keep this clear of the Layer-3 synthesized-signal failure:

- **No fabrication.** A tap sets only the attributes it speaks to. `sweetness`,
  `aftertaste`, `aroma`, `flavor`, `fragrance` are never set from a tap — a coarse
  impression must not invent a descriptive score.
- **Never clear.** A mapped CVA field is written ONLY when the local tap is set,
  and never sent as null. So a shot the user never taps in Decenza never has its
  CVA fields written or cleared — anything scored by hand in Visualizer's
  assessment form survives. (The mapping does not read remote state, so for a
  shot the user *does* tap, the tap is authoritative for the mapped fields.) This
  is the same class of caution as the removed `enjoyment_source`, which silently
  overwrote the user's Visualizer default-rating setting.

The mapping is one-directional (Decenza → Visualizer). The local chip enum is the
source of truth; we do not reverse-map CVA scores back into a chip.

**Upload happens at capture time via the existing auto-sync gates — no new
trigger.** A taste tap on the **post-shot review page** persists through
`saveEditedShot`, which sets `pendingVisualizerUpdate` and lets
`maybeAutoUpdateVisualizer` PATCH the shot when `visualizerAutoUpdate` is on — so
the mapped CVA fields push to Visualizer at capture time, with no new trigger.
(There is no shot-level `touchesVisualizerFields()` — that helper is a
coffee-bag concept; the shot path is `pendingVisualizerUpdate` +
`buildVisualizerOverrides`, which now carries the two taste keys.) A tap made in
the **AI intake dialog** persists to the DB via `requestUpdateShotMetadata` but
does NOT itself fire a Visualizer PATCH; it syncs on the next review-page edit or
manual upload. With auto-sync off, all taps persist locally and upload on the next
push, like every other shot field.

## Risks / open questions

- **Body's weak justification** (see decision 3). Ship with it; revisit if it
  proves noisy in advice quality.
- **Migration cost of being wrong.** `enjoyment_source` was added (migration 14)
  and dropped (migration 16) within 11 days, requiring a data reset + deferred
  Visualizer back-sync. Two new columns carry the same unwind cost if taste turns
  out unused. The adaptive-UX requirement and the double-win are what justify
  accepting that risk now.
- **Compose wording.** The tap→sentence mapping should read naturally and not
  over-claim (e.g. don't assert "sour" as fact to the model beyond "I tasted…").
  Kept qualitative and first-person.
