# MCP Server for Decenza

## Context

Add an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to Decenza so AI assistants (Claude Desktop, etc.) can fully monitor and control the DE1 espresso machine over the network. The MCP server rides on the existing ShotServer HTTP infrastructure at `/mcp`, reusing TLS, auth, and socket management. The user configures MCP behavior (on/off, access level, confirmation level) in the AI settings tab, which gets reorganized into sections to accommodate the new controls.

## Architecture

### Transport: Streamable HTTP (MCP 2025-03-26 spec)

- **POST /mcp** — JSON-RPC 2.0 requests (initialize, tools/call, resources/read, etc.)
- **GET /mcp** — SSE stream for server-initiated notifications (resource changes)
- **DELETE /mcp** — terminate session
- Session tracked via `Mcp-Session` header (separate from auth cookies)

### File Structure

```
src/mcp/
  mcpserver.h/cpp           — Session management, JSON-RPC dispatch, SSE
  mcpsession.h/cpp          — Per-client state (capabilities, SSE socket, subscriptions)
  mcptoolregistry.h/cpp     — Tool definitions registry + dispatch
  mcpresourceregistry.h/cpp — Resource definitions registry
  mcptools_machine.cpp      — Machine control + state tools
  mcptools_shots.cpp        — Shot history + feedback tools
  mcptools_profiles.cpp     — Profile management tools
  mcptools_settings.cpp     — Settings read/write tools
  mcptools_dialing.cpp      — Dial-in conversation tools (context bundle, suggest/apply changes)
```

### Class Design

**McpServer** — main coordinator, owned by main.cpp stack:
- Receives HTTP requests forwarded from ShotServer for `/mcp` paths
- Manages sessions (`QHash<QString, McpSession*>`)
- Dispatches JSON-RPC methods to tool/resource registries
- Checks `Settings::mcpEnabled()` — returns 404 for all `/mcp` requests when disabled
- Checks `Settings::mcpAccessLevel()` — filters tool list and rejects calls based on level
- Checks `Settings::mcpConfirmationLevel()` — decides which ops need UI confirmation
- Dependency injection: DE1Device, MachineState, MainController, ShotHistoryStorage, Settings

**McpSession** — per-client:
- Session ID (UUID), created/lastActivity timestamps
- `initialized` flag (set after handshake)
- Client capabilities from initialize
- Subscribed resource URIs
- SSE socket (QPointer, nullable)

**McpToolRegistry** — tool definitions + handlers:
- `registerTool(name, description, inputSchema, handler, category)` — category is "read", "control", or "settings"
- `listTools(accessLevel)` → JSON array filtered by access level
- `callTool(name, arguments, accessLevel, confirmationLevel)` → JSON result
- `hasTool(name)` → bool

**McpResourceRegistry** — resource definitions + readers:
- `registerResource(uri, name, description, mimeType, reader)`
- `listResources()` → JSON array
- `readResource(uri)` → JSON content

## Settings: MCP Configuration (new `Settings` properties)

```cpp
// MCP Server settings
Q_PROPERTY(bool mcpEnabled READ mcpEnabled WRITE setMcpEnabled NOTIFY mcpEnabledChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(int mcpAccessLevel READ mcpAccessLevel WRITE setMcpAccessLevel NOTIFY mcpAccessLevelChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(int mcpConfirmationLevel READ mcpConfirmationLevel WRITE setMcpConfirmationLevel NOTIFY mcpConfirmationLevelChanged)
```

### Access Levels (mcpAccessLevel)
| Value | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Monitor Only | Read machine state, telemetry, shot history, profiles — no control |
| 1 | Control | Everything in Monitor + start/stop operations, skip frame, wake/sleep |
| 2 | Full Automation | Everything in Control + upload profiles, change settings, set active profile |

### Confirmation Levels (mcpConfirmationLevel)
| Value | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | None | All allowed commands execute immediately |
| 1 | Dangerous Only | Start operations (espresso/steam/hotwater/flush), profile uploads, settings changes require UI confirmation |
| 2 | All Control | Every machine control and write operation requires confirmation |

### Tool Category → Access Level Mapping

Each tool has a `category` that determines the minimum access level required:

| Category | Min Access Level | Tools |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| `read` | 0 (Monitor) | machine_get_state, app_get_info, machine_get_telemetry, shots_list, shots_get_detail, shots_get_debug_log, shots_compare, profiles_list, profiles_get_active, profiles_get_detail, profiles_get_params, profiles_get_auto_load, settings_get, dialing_get_context, dialing_get_grinder_calibration, bag_list, equipment_list, recipe_list, recipe_get, steam_pitcher_list, water_vessel_list |
| `control` | 1 (Control) | machine_wake, machine_sleep, machine_start_espresso, machine_start_steam, machine_start_hot_water, machine_start_flush, machine_stop, machine_skip_frame, shots_update, shots_upload_to_visualizer, backup_now, mqtt_connect, mqtt_disconnect, mqtt_publish_discovery, devices_connect_de1, devices_disconnect_scale, devices_reset_scale_priority, bag_select, equipment_select, steam_pitcher_select, water_vessel_select, bag_extract_details  |
| `settings` | 2 (Full) | profiles_set_active, profiles_edit_params, profiles_save, profiles_delete, profiles_create, profiles_rename, shots_delete, settings_set, reset_saw_learning, clear_flow_calibration, apply_theme, bag_create, bag_update, equipment_update, recipe_create, recipe_update, recipe_create_from_shot, recipe_clone, recipe_archive, steam_pitcher_add, steam_pitcher_update, steam_pitcher_delete, water_vessel_add, water_vessel_update, water_vessel_delete |

### Tool → Confirmation Level Mapping

Two confirmation mechanisms are used depending on where the user is:

- **In-app dialog**: For machine start operations — the user is physically at the machine and must approve on screen
- **Chat-based**: For settings/data operations — the user is at their desk interacting with the AI remotely

| Tool | Dangerous Only (1) | All Control (2) | Mechanism |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| machine_start_* | **Confirm** | Confirm | In-app dialog |
| machine_wake/sleep | No confirm | Confirm | Chat |
| machine_stop | No confirm | Confirm | Chat |
| machine_skip_frame | No confirm | Confirm | Chat |
| profiles_set_active | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| profiles_edit_params | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| profiles_save | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| profiles_delete | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| profiles_create | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| profiles_rename | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| shots_delete | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| settings_set | **Confirm** | Confirm | Chat |
| shots_update | No confirm | No confirm | — |
| shots_upload_to_visualizer | No confirm | No confirm | — |

When confirmation level is 0 (None), all tools execute immediately regardless of mechanism.

### In-App Confirmation (machine_start_* tools)

For operations that physically affect the machine, confirmation happens on the device screen where the user can see and control the machine:

1. `McpServer::handleToolsCall()` detects the tool needs in-app confirmation
2. The HTTP response is **held** — stored in `PendingConfirmation` with a `QPointer<QTcpSocket>`
3. McpServer emits `confirmationRequested(toolName, toolDescription, sessionId)`
4. QML shows `McpConfirmDialog`: "An AI assistant wants to: Start pulling an espresso shot. Allow?"
5. The dialog has a **15-second auto-dismiss timer** (legitimate UI auto-dismiss per CLAUDE.md) that denies by default
6. The dialog's `onClosed` signal drives the C++ callback — not the raw timer. The timer only closes the dialog UI; `onClosed` then calls `McpServer::confirmationResolved(sessionId, accepted)`
7. `confirmationResolved` executes the tool (if accepted) or returns an error (if denied), sending the held HTTP response

**Edge cases**: If the socket disconnects while waiting, the response is dropped (logged). If a new confirmation arrives while one is pending, the old one is auto-denied first.

**McpConfirmDialog implementation notes**:
- Use `property string toolDescription` for the text — NOT `message` or `description`, which are FINAL on `Dialog` in Qt 6.10+
- Use `AccessibleButton` for Confirm/Deny buttons — not raw `Rectangle+MouseArea`
- Announce dialog text via `AccessibilityManager.announce()` when opened

### Chat-Based Confirmation (settings/data tools)

For operations where the user is at their desk interacting with the AI remotely (not at the machine):

1. `McpServer::handleToolsCall()` checks if the tool needs chat confirmation and `"confirmed"` is not in the arguments
2. If not confirmed, returns immediately with: `{"needs_confirmation": true, "action": "settings_set", "description": "Change machine settings", "parameters": {...}}`
3. The AI sees this response and asks the user in chat: "I'd like to change the brew temperature to 94°C. Should I proceed?"
4. If the user approves, the AI re-calls the tool with `"confirmed": true` in the arguments
5. The tool executes normally (the `confirmed` key is stripped before passing to the handler)

This avoids holding HTTP connections and works naturally with the conversational AI flow. The `confirmed` parameter is declared in each tool's `inputSchema` so the AI knows to include it.

## Tools (Full Set)

### Machine Control
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `machine_wake` | Wake from sleep | control |
| `machine_sleep` | Put to sleep | control |
| `machine_start_espresso` | Start pulling a shot. Optional brew overrides (dose, yield, temperature, grind) apply for this shot only, matching QML BrewDialog. | control |
| `machine_start_steam` | Start steaming | control |
| `machine_start_hot_water` | Dispense hot water | control |
| `machine_start_flush` | Flush group head | control |
| `machine_stop` | Stop current operation | control |
| `machine_skip_frame` | Skip to next profile frame | control |

### Machine State
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `machine_get_state` | Phase, connection, readiness, heating status, water level (ml + mm), firmware version, active profile name. Platform/OS info has moved to `app_get_info` (#988) to keep tight polling responses small. | read |
| `app_get_info` | App and device info: appVersion, qtVersion, OS, kernel, architecture, deviceModel, screen size/DPI, devicePixelRatio. Diagnostics-grade — call once per session. | read |
| `machine_get_telemetry` | Live pressure, flow, temp, weight, goal values. During a shot, also returns the current shot's time-series data so far (not just the latest sample) so the AI can detect channeling or stalling mid-shot. | read |
| `steam_get_health` | Detailed steam-system health: baseline + current pressure/temperature, flow-restriction progress toward warn thresholds, status, and recommendation. Used for steam-wand cleaning / descaling guidance. | read |

### Shot History
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `shots_list` | List shots with filters (limit, offset, profile, bean, enjoyment, after/before date range) | read |
| `shots_get_detail` | Full shot record with time-series data | read |
| `shots_get_debug_log` | Per-shot debug log (BLE frames, phase transitions, SAW events, flow calibration). Paginated with offset/limit. | read |
| `shots_compare` | Side-by-side comparison of 2+ shots with auto-computed change diffs (grind, dose, yield, duration) | read |
| `shots_update` | Update any metadata field on a shot: enjoyment, notes, dose, yield, bean info, grinder info, barista, TDS, EY. Same fields the QML shot editor can change. Replaces the old `shots_set_feedback`. If the shot already has a `visualizer_id` and `visualizerAutoUpdate` is on, the edits are auto-PATCHed up to visualizer.coffee (response includes `visualizerUpdateTriggered`). | control |
| `shots_upload_to_visualizer` | Upload a historical shot to visualizer.coffee for the first time (POST). Use for shots that were never auto-uploaded and therefore have no `visualizer_id` yet. Refuses to re-upload an existing shot (points the caller at `shots_update` to PATCH instead) and rejects upfront if the shot is a maintenance profile, shorter than `visualizerMinDuration`, or credentials are missing. Response: `{success, uploadTriggered, message}`; the new `visualizer_id` lands in the local DB when the network response arrives. | control |
| `shots_delete` | Delete a shot by ID. Permanent and cannot be undone. | settings |

`shots_get_detail` also surfaces the shot's coffee bag snapshot (bean-bag-inventory): sparse-emitted `bagId`, `frozenDate`, `defrostDate` (ISO dates; pre-bag shots and unfrozen beans omit them).

### Coffee Bags (bean-bag-inventory)
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `bag_list` | List coffee bags (inventory by default; `includeEmpty=true` adds bags marked empty). Each bag carries identity, `kind` ("coffee"/"tea", creation-time), freeze lifecycle, last-used grinder/dose, a parsed `beanBase` snapshot, `isActive`, and — tea bags — the structured brewing fields (teaType, brewTemperatureC, leafGramsPer100Ml, steepTime). | read |
| `bag_select` | Set the active bag — what the next shot is pulled with (applies bean identity + last-used grinder/dose). `bagId: 0` clears the selection. | control |
| `bag_extract_details` | Run the "Get info from page" AI extraction for a bag's URL and return the fields WITHOUT writing (bag_update applies them). Reports stage (1 local fetch / 2 provider web-fetch fallback) + provider/model. Consumes provider tokens. | control |
| `bag_create` | Create an inventory bag; `kind` = coffee (default) \| tea, stamped at creation and immutable — the MCP counterpart of Add Coffee / Add Tea. Tea vocabulary only on tea bags; roastLevel/grinderSetting only on coffee. NOT auto-activated (use `bag_select`). | settings |
| `bag_update` | Update bag fields (metadata + freeze lifecycle + bean/tea details). Partial: only provided keys change; `""` clears a text/date field. `inInventory=false` = "Bag finished" (marks the bag empty); setting `defrostDate` records a thaw. `kind` is NOT editable (creation-time identity); tea vocabulary is rejected on coffee bags. | settings |

### Equipment Packages (add-equipment-packages)
The grinder is a first-class, switchable **equipment package** (the active bag points at one via `equipment_id`). The grind setting + `rpm` stay as per-bag dial-in.
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `equipment_list` | List equipment packages. Each carries `id`, `name`, `grinderBrand/Model/Burrs`, `rpmAdjustable`, `inInventory`, last dial (`lastGrindSetting`/`lastRpm`), `shotCount`, and `isActive`. | read |
| `equipment_select` | Set the active equipment package — the grinder the next shot is ground on. Applies the package's grinder identity + last grind/rpm and points the active bag at it. | control |
| `equipment_update` | Edit a package's grinder identity (`grinderBrand/Model/Burrs`) and/or `name`. Partial; re-derives `rpmAdjustable`. Reference semantics (applies to all referencing bags/shots). | settings |

The `de1://dialing` resource's grinder block also exposes `packageId`, `rpmAdjustable`, and `rpm`.

### Recipes (add-recipes)
A recipe is the whole drink: profile + bean link + equipment + dose/yield/temp + the recipe's own grind + steam block. Grind always lives on the recipe (fix-recipe-grind-integrity): responses expose it as `grind: {value, rpm}` (the key is omitted when the recipe has no grind) with no inherited/pinned mode — nothing resolves from the bag. A create that links a bag but *omits* `grindPinned` adopts the bag's current dial at save time (an explicitly empty string stores no grind). Mutations run through the app's RecipeStorage so the UI refreshes like a local edit; `recipe_activate` uses MainController's single activation path (identical to the idle pill tap).
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `recipe_list` | List recipes (MRU order, `isActive` marks the machine's current setup; `includeArchived=true` adds archived ones). Each recipe carries `drinkType` (stored, or derived for legacy rows). | read |
| `recipe_get` | One recipe fully resolved: its own grind, the linked bag's identity/status, steam block. | read |
| `recipe_create` | Create from explicit fields; only `name` always required — `profileTitle` is required unless the payload carries a hot-water block with `hasWater` true (profile-less hot-water tea). Accepts `drinkType` (derived from blocks when omitted). | settings |
| `recipe_update` | Partial update; `grindPinned` is the recipe's own grind (`""` clears it). Block/profile changes re-derive `drinkType` unless set in the same call; clearing `profileTitle` requires an active hot-water block in the same call. | settings |
| `recipe_create_from_shot` | The promotion path: prefills from a shot record + its steam snapshot (fallback: current steam settings); the shot's own recorded grind/rpm become the recipe's grind. | settings |
| `recipe_clone` | Copy + rename (family-variant workflow); provenance points at the source recipe. | settings |
| `recipe_archive` | Archive (used recipes can never be hard-deleted — same rule as bags); `restore=true` unarchives, `delete=true` hard-deletes an unused recipe. | settings |
| `recipe_activate` | Apply the whole drink: profile, the linked bag (a bean-less recipe clears the active bag), equipment, dose/yield/temp, the recipe's own grind, steam (+ heater warm-up when `hasMilk`). | control |

### Profile Management
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `profiles_list` | List all available profiles | read |
| `profiles_get_active` | Get current profile name + details | read |
| `profiles_get_detail` | Full profile JSON by filename | read |
| `profiles_get_params` | Get the current profile's editable recipe parameters, tailored to its editor type (dflow, aflow, pressure, flow). Returns all parameters that can be passed to `profiles_edit_params`. | read |
| `profiles_set_active` | Load and activate a profile | settings |
| `profiles_edit_params` | Edit the current profile's recipe parameters and regenerate frames. Only provide fields you want to change — unspecified fields keep their current values. Triggers frame regeneration and uploads to machine. Profile is marked modified but not saved to disk — call `profiles_save` to persist. | settings |
| `profiles_save` | Save the current (modified) profile to disk. Without this, edits are active on the machine but lost if another profile is loaded. Optionally provide filename + title for Save As. | settings |
| `profiles_delete` | Delete a user/downloaded profile. For built-in profiles, removes local overrides and reverts to the original built-in version. | settings |
| `profiles_create` | Create a new blank profile with a given editor type (dflow, aflow, pressure, flow, advanced) and title. Uses the same creation functions as the QML UI. | settings |
| `profiles_rename` | Rename a user/downloaded profile in place — changes only the display title, keeps the filename so favorites/auto-load/selected references stay valid. Built-in profiles are read-only and rejected (use `profiles_save` Save As to copy). | settings |
| `profiles_get_auto_load` | Get the configured auto-load profile filename, title, and revert-minutes. Returns `filename: ""` and the current `revertMinutes` when no auto-load is set. | read |
| `profiles_set_auto_load` | Pin a profile as the auto-load target (reloads on app start, DE1 wake, and after N idle minutes on the Idle page). Validates filename existence + Selected-list membership. Accepts optional `revertMinutes` (0..60). | settings |
| `profiles_clear_auto_load` | Disable auto-load by clearing the pinned filename. Preserves the configured `revertMinutes`. | settings |

### Settings
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `settings_get` | Read all app settings, specific keys, or a category. Categories: machine, calibration, connections, screensaver, accessibility, ai, espresso, steam, water, flush, dye, mqtt, themes, visualizer, update, data, history, language, debug, battery, heater, autofavorites. The `ai` category includes `aiProvider`, the effective `aiModel` + `aiModelDisplay` for the active provider, and `aiAvailableModels` (the catalog of selectable `{id,name}` for that provider — use it to discover valid `aiModel` values). Sensitive fields (API keys, passwords) are excluded. | read |
| `settings_set` | Update any app setting across all QML Settings tabs. Covers 100+ fields: machine, calibration, connections, screensaver, accessibility, AI, espresso, steam, water, flush, DYE, MQTT, themes, visualizer, update, data, history, language, debug, battery, heater, auto-favorites. `aiProvider` selects the provider; `aiModel` selects the model for the active (or same-call) provider, validated against that provider's catalog (invalid ids rejected with `validModels`); OpenRouter/Ollama use `openrouterModel`/`ollamaModel`. Sensitive fields (API keys, passwords) excluded. | settings |
| `reset_saw_learning` | Reset stop-at-weight learning data globally. Useful when switching beans or grind settings. | settings |
| `reset_saw_learning_for_profile` | Reset stop-at-weight learning for a single (profile, scale) pair only — other pairs and the global bootstrap are preserved. Defaults to active profile + configured scale. | settings |
| `clear_flow_calibration` | Clear per-profile flow calibration multiplier. Defaults to current profile if none specified. | settings |
| `apply_theme` | Apply a preset theme ('Default Dark', 'Default Light', or user-created). | settings |
| `backup_now` | Create an immediate backup of database, settings, profiles, and media. | control |
| `mqtt_connect` | Connect to the configured MQTT broker. | control |
| `mqtt_disconnect` | Disconnect from the MQTT broker. | control |
| `mqtt_publish_discovery` | Publish Home Assistant MQTT discovery messages. Requires connected broker. | control |

### Steam & Hot Water Presets
Steam pitcher / hot-water vessel presets each carry their own duration/flow/volume and a **per-preset temperature**. `*_select` switches the active preset and applies it to the machine (like `bag_select`/`equipment_select`); `*_add` appends and selects the new preset; updates are partial (only provided fields change, and editing the selected preset re-applies it). Units are human-readable (temperatureC, flowMlPerSec, durationSec, volumeMl) — the store keeps steam flow in hundredths and water flow in tenths of mL/s, converted in the tool layer.
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `steam_pitcher_list` | List steam pitcher presets (name, durationSec, flowMlPerSec, temperatureC; pitcherWeightG/calibMilkG when calibrated; disabled "Off" presets carry only name+disabled) plus `selectedIndex`. | read |
| `steam_pitcher_add` | Add a steam pitcher preset and select it. Optional durationSec/flowMlPerSec/temperatureC (temperature defaults to the current global steam temperature); `disabled=true` adds an "Off" preset that turns the heater off. | settings |
| `steam_pitcher_update` | Update a pitcher by index — partial; unspecified fields keep their values. Editing the selected pitcher re-applies it to the machine. Disabled presets can't be edited (delete + re-add). | settings |
| `steam_pitcher_delete` | Delete a steam pitcher preset by index. | settings |
| `steam_pitcher_select` | Switch the active pitcher by index; applies its duration/flow/temperature to the machine. | control |
| `water_vessel_list` | List hot water vessel presets (name, volumeMl, mode "weight"/"volume", flowMlPerSec, temperatureC) plus `selectedIndex`. | read |
| `water_vessel_add` | Add a hot water vessel preset and select it. Optional volumeMl/mode/flowMlPerSec/temperatureC (temperature defaults to the current global hot water temperature). | settings |
| `water_vessel_update` | Update a vessel by index — partial. Editing the selected vessel re-applies it to the machine. | settings |
| `water_vessel_delete` | Delete a hot water vessel preset by index. | settings |
| `water_vessel_select` | Switch the active vessel by index; applies its volume/mode/flow/temperature to the machine. | control |

### Devices & Scale
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `devices_list` | List discovered BLE devices (DE1 machines and scales) | read |
| `devices_scan` | Start scanning for BLE devices | control |
| `devices_connect_scale` | Connect to a scale by BLE address | control |
| `devices_connect_de1` | Connect to a DE1 machine by BLE address | control |
| `devices_disconnect_scale` | Disconnect and forget the current BLE scale | control |
| `devices_connection_status` | Get connection status of DE1 machine and scale, incl. in-memory scale connection-priority (dual-HIGH backoff) state | read |
| `devices_reset_scale_priority` | Clear the in-memory scale connection-priority dual-HIGH backoff latch (re-detects on next scale (re)connect; eventually-consistent) | control |
| `scale_tare` | Tare (zero) the connected scale | control |
| `scale_timer_start` | Start the scale's built-in timer | control |
| `scale_timer_stop` | Stop the scale's built-in timer | control |
| `scale_timer_reset` | Reset the scale's built-in timer | control |
| `scale_get_weight` | Get current weight and flow rate from the scale | read |

### Debug & Agent
| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `debug_get_log` | Read the persisted app debug log. Three modes: (1) `sessions=true` lists all sessions with index/start line/timestamp/line count; (2) `session=N` returns lines from that session (-1 = most recent); (3) default — raw line-based pagination via `offset`/`limit` (1–2000 lines). | read |
| `get_agent_file` | Returns the current Decenza `claude_agent.md` system-prompt content + the app's version string. Any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude mobile, Claude Code, etc.) should call this at session start to load behavioral guidance for dialing assistance. Clients with filesystem access (Claude Code Remote Control) additionally use the version to self-update a local CLAUDE.md. | read |

### AI Dial-In Conversation (key feature)

The MCP enables an external AI (e.g. Claude Desktop) to act as a dial-in advisor with full machine context. Unlike the in-app AI which uses a cloud provider and limited context, an MCP-connected AI can use its own capabilities with direct access to machine tools.

| Tool | Description | Category |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `dialing_get_context` | Get full dial-in context bundle: current profile recipe + profile knowledge (includes espresso system prompt, dial-in reference tables, and profile-specific KB) + recent shot summary (via `ShotSummarizer`) + dial-in history (last N shots with same profile family) + bean metadata + grinder context (observed settings range and step size). This is the primary read tool for dial-in — a single call gives the AI everything it needs to analyze a shot and suggest changes. The cross-profile grinder calibration table is **not** in this bundle — see `dialing_get_grinder_calibration` (#1164). | read |
| `dialing_get_grinder_calibration` | On-demand cross-profile grinder calibration: per-user recommended grinder setting (rgs) for every KB espresso profile, derived from all-time shot history on the same grinder model + burrs. Returns `fineAnchor` / `coarseAnchor`, `conversionKey`, `calibratedUgsRange`, and a `profiles[]` array (each with `ugs`, `rgs`, `source` ∈ history/derived/extrapolated). Split out of `dialing_get_context` (#1164) because it is a ~33-row table that only matters when the user is weighing a profile switch and is a stable physical property of the grinder — so the AI fetches it once on demand instead of re-receiving it every conversational turn. Returns `{available:false, reason}` when fewer than 2 qualifying anchor profiles exist. Same shared `DialingBlocks::buildGrinderCalibrationBlock()` builder the one-shot in-app advisor / `ai_advisor_invoke` still use inline. | read |
| ~~`dialing_suggest_change`~~ | **Removed.** Was a no-op stub that returned `"suggestion_displayed"` without actually displaying anything or changing settings. The AI mistakenly treated it as applying changes (e.g., grind size). Use `settings_set` to change grind (`dyeGrinderSetting`), dose (`dyeBeanWeight`), yield (`targetWeight`), temperature (`espressoTemperature`), etc. | — |
| ~~`dialing_apply_change`~~ | **Removed.** Was a convenience wrapper that duplicated `settings_set` + `profiles_set_active`. Caused the advanced-profile-corruption bug due to duplicated code paths. Use `settings_set` for temp/weight/DYE changes and `profiles_set_active` for profile switches. | — |

**Design note — why one read tool instead of four:** An earlier version had separate `dialing_get_shot_summary`, `dialing_get_history`, `dialing_get_profile_knowledge`, and `dialing_get_context` tools. These were consolidated into just `dialing_get_context` because: (1) the MCP client almost always needs all the context together, (2) fewer tools means better MCP client compatibility and less confusion for the AI, (3) the individual data is still available via generic tools (`shots_get_detail`, `profiles_get_detail`, `settings_get`) if needed. The `dialing_get_context` tool accepts optional parameters to control what's included (e.g., `shot_id` to analyze a specific shot instead of the most recent, `history_limit` to control how many prior shots to include).

The later `dialing_get_grinder_calibration` split (#1164) does **not** reverse this consolidation: the cross-profile RGS table is not part of "the context the client almost always needs together" — it is a large, stable table that is only relevant during a profile-switch discussion. Keeping it out of the always-on bundle and fetching it once on demand is a payload-cost decision, not a re-split of the shot/history/knowledge bundle.

**Payload-cost discipline (#1164):** the principle is *cache by not resending*. On the MCP path Decenza cannot attach `cache_control` (the external client owns the Anthropic call), so the only lever is "emit stable content once, never resend a different copy" — once it is in the conversation, the external client's prompt cache covers it for free. Three cuts implement this:

1. **`includeFullKnowledge` is now actually gated** (#1164 finding #1). The lite branch of `dialing_get_context` used to append the full cross-profile reference catalog + UGS tables + families/discipline framing (~17 KB) unconditionally for espresso, contradicting the tool's documented contract and dominating per-call token cost. The default now ships only the current profile's KB entry (~1 KB) plus a compact guardrail that tells the AI to fetch the full reference **once** via `includeFullKnowledge: true` at session start (stable → stays in context, no re-request) and not to quote other-profile setpoints from memory until it has. The in-app advisor path is unaffected — it carries the full system prompt in a `cache_control`-wrapped system block (`aiprovider.cpp`), so it is already cache-optimal.
2. **Grinder calibration → on-demand tool** (#1164 finding #2, above).
3. **`dialInSessions` session-context hoisting extended** (#1164 finding #3). `profileName`, `targetWeightG`, and `temperatureOverrideC` now follow the same hoist discipline as grinder/bean identity and `pourControl` (#1158): when every shot in a session shares the value it is emitted once on `session.context`; a per-shot field appears only when a session genuinely mixes the value. A dial-in session is almost always one profile at one target weight and temperature, so this removes near-total per-shot repetition.

**How the dial-in flow works via MCP:**

1. User pulls a shot → AI gets notified via SSE (`decenza://shots/recent` resource update)
2. AI calls `dialing_get_context` to get the full picture (shot data, profile knowledge, history, reference tables)
3. AI analyzes the shot using its own reasoning (no cloud API call needed — the AI IS the reasoning engine)
4. AI responds in chat with its recommendation
5. If user approves, AI calls `settings_set` to adjust grind/dose/yield/temperature
6. AI can ask the user how the shot tasted and call `shots_update` to record enjoyment/notes
7. Next shot: repeat, with the AI seeing the progression via `dialing_get_context` history

**What context is available to the MCP AI:**

| Context Layer | Source | Tool |
|---------------|--------|------|
| Profile recipe (frame-by-frame) | Profile JSON | `dialing_get_context` / `profiles_get_detail` |
| Profile knowledge (system prompt + reference tables + per-profile KB + profile catalog + cross-profile guidance) | `ShotSummarizer::shotAnalysisSystemPrompt()` — shared with in-app AI | `dialing_get_context` |
| Shot data (curves, phases, anomalies) | `ShotSummarizer` | `dialing_get_context` / `shots_get_detail` |
| Dial-in history (last N shots, same profile) | `ShotHistoryStorage::getRecentShotsByKbId()` | `dialing_get_context` |
| Grinder context (observed settings range, step size, burr-swappable flag) | `ShotHistoryStorage::queryGrinderContext()` + `GrinderAliases` — shared with in-app AI | `dialing_get_context` |
| Grinder calibration (per-user RGS for every KB profile, derived from all-time anchor shots on same grinder+burrs) | `DialingBlocks::buildGrinderCalibrationBlock()` — shared with in-app AI | `dialing_get_grinder_calibration` (on demand); in-app advisor / `ai_advisor_invoke` inline |
| Bean metadata (brand, type, roast, grinder, burrs) | Shot metadata / Settings DYE | `dialing_get_context` |
| Machine telemetry (live pressure/flow/temp) | `MachineState` / `DE1Device` | `machine_get_telemetry` |
| All available profiles | Profile list | `profiles_list` |
| Water level | `DE1Device::waterLevelMl()` / `waterLevelMm()` | `machine_get_state` |

The MCP AI still has advantages over the in-app AI: it's not limited by token budgets or cloud API costs, and it can maintain a long conversation across multiple shots without context trimming. However, as of PR #635/#647, both paths share the same system prompt (including reference tables, profile catalog with cross-profile recommendation guidance, and burr-swappable grinder enrichment), grinder context logic, and profile knowledge — changes to shared components benefit both equally.

## AI-Friendly Data Conventions

MCP tool responses are consumed by LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) which cannot reliably interpret raw numbers without context. All numeric fields in MCP responses follow these conventions:

- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 with timezone offset (e.g., `"2026-03-21T11:20:41-06:00"`), never Unix epoch
- **Units in field names**: Numeric fields include their unit as a suffix — `doseG` (grams), `pressureBar` (bar), `temperatureC` (Celsius), `flowMlPerSec` (ml/s), `durationSec` (seconds), `weightG` (grams), `targetVolumeMl` (ml)
- **Scales in field names**: Bounded values indicate their range — `enjoyment0to100` (0-100 rating)
- **Human-readable enums**: Machine phases, editor types, and states are returned as strings (`"idle"`, `"pouring"`, `"dflow"`), not numeric codes
- **`stoppedBy` marks whether a yield is a real outcome** (#1161): shots in `dialing_get_context` (`dialInSessions[].shots[]`, `bestRecentShot`) and `shots_list` carry a sparse `stoppedBy` ∈ `"weight"` (stop-at-weight) / `"volume"` (stop-at-volume) / `"manual"` (user tapped Stop). It is **omitted** when the profile ran to completion or the DE1's own button was used (the BLE protocol can't distinguish those) — the AI then falls back to `yieldG` vs `targetWeightG`. A `"manual"` shot's yield/ratio/duration are user-chosen, not extraction outcomes, so the shared `shotAnalysisSystemPrompt` instructs the AI not to diagnose grind/ratio from them; an absent `stoppedBy` with `yieldG` well below `targetWeightG` is treated the same. Classified in `MainController::onShotEnded` (SAW/SAV C++ state is ground truth; QML's resolved `stopReason` supplies "manual" via `reportShotStopReason`), persisted in `shots.stopped_by` (migration 17).
- **Shot identity in prose is date/time, never the numeric `id`** (#1162): the per-shot `id` is an internal DB primary key with no user-facing counterpart — Shot History and every user surface key shots by date/time. The AI must cite shots to the user by their local `timestamp` ("your May 10, 9:04 AM shot"), using `id` only as an opaque argument to other tools. This rule is delivered to MCP clients via the server-level `instructions` string in the `initialize` result (retained for the whole session, beverage-agnostic, zero per-call cost) and reinforced in the shared `shotAnalysisSystemPrompt` (`## How to Read Structured Fields`). Two carriers because the full system prompt only reaches MCP clients that call `ai_advisor_invoke` (always carries it) or `dialing_get_context` with `includeFullKnowledge: true` (opt-in since #1164); for a client that does neither, the handshake `instructions` is the only carrier. The `instructions` field is gated on `negotiatedVersion >= "2025-03-26"` (the revision that introduced it) so strict `2024-11-05` clients don't reject the `initialize` response — same discipline as the `structuredContent` / `resource_link` gates in `buildToolCallResponse()`.

When adding new MCP tool responses, never return raw numbers that require domain knowledge to interpret. An AI seeing `"pressure": 9.0` doesn't know if that's bar, PSI, or kPa. Use `"pressureBar": 9.0` instead.

### Shot Detector Outputs (`shots_get_detail`, `shots_compare`)

`shots_get_detail` and `shots_compare` return two complementary views of the in-app Shot Summary detector pipeline:

- **`summaryLines`** — the same human-readable observation list rendered by the in-app Shot Summary dialog. Each entry is `{"text": "...", "type": "good" | "caution" | "warning" | "observation" | "verdict"}`. Useful when you want to surface the dialog's own framing.
- **`detectorResults`** — structured outputs of the detectors, intended as the primary signal for external agents. Avoids parsing prose, and the field shapes are stable across detector wording changes.

Both are populated by a single call to `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot`, so they cannot drift: the prose lines are formatted FROM the same struct that becomes `detectorResults`. A detector flip moves both fields together.

`detectorResults` shape (fields are present only when their `checked` flag / `hasData` flag is true):

```json
{
  "channeling": { "checked": true, "severity": "none" | "transient" | "sustained", "spikeTimeSec": 18.2 },
  "flowTrend":  { "checked": true, "direction": "stable" | "rising" | "falling", "deltaMlPerSec": 0.3 },
  "preinfusion": { "observed": true, "dripWeightG": 1.4, "durationSec": 8.3 },
  "grind": {
    "checked": true, "hasData": true,
    "direction": "tooFine" | "tooCoarse" | "onTarget" | "chokedPuck" | "yieldOvershoot",
    "deltaMlPerSec": -0.6, "sampleCount": 142,
    "chokedPuck": false, "yieldOvershoot": false, "verifiedClean": false,
    "yieldRatio": 0.64,                                  // finalWeightG / targetWeightG; absent when either is 0
    "coverage": "verified" | "notAnalyzable" | "skipped",  // present unless pourTruncated cascade is active
    "gates": {                                           // present whenever Arm 2 (choked-puck arm) walked the pour;
                                                         //   absent if pressure curve was empty or beverage type skipped
      "passed": false,
      "flowSamples": 12,
      "pressurizedDurationSec": 8.76,
      "meanPressurizedFlowMlPerSec": 2.43,
      "yieldRatio": 0.64,
      "minSamples": 5,
      "minPressurizedSec": 15.0,
      "minPressureBar": 4.0,
      "chokedFlowMaxMlPerSec": 0.5,
      "chokedYieldRatioMax": 0.85,
      "yieldOvershootRatioMin": 1.20
    }
  },
  "pourTruncated": false,
  "peakPressureBar": 9.1,        // present only when pourTruncated == true
  "pourStartSec": 6.2,           // phase-boundary window analyzeShot used to gate every other detector;
                                 //   stays 0.0 when no "preinfusion"/"pour" markers are present (whole-shot fallback)
  "pourEndSec": 32.8,            // defaults to shot duration when no "end" marker is present;
                                 //   both fields are 0.0 only on the insufficient-data early return (pressure.size() < 10)
  "skipFirstFrame": false,
  "verdictCategory": "minorIssuesGrindFine"
}
```

`verdictCategory` values:
- `"clean"` — no warnings or cautions; grind was verified or skipped
- `"cleanGrindNotAnalyzable"` — no warnings or cautions, but the grind detector could not analyze this profile shape (Arm 1 windows lay before pourStart and Arm 2's pressurized-duration gate didn't fire). Distinct from `"clean"` so consumers can differentiate "verified healthy" from "we silently had no data."
- `"insufficientData"` — pressure series had fewer than 10 samples; `analyzeShot` bailed without running any detectors (every `checked` flag stays false).
- `"puckTruncated"` — pour never pressurized; channeling / grind / temp signals are unreliable
- `"skipFirstFrame"` — DE1 firmware bug or first-step too short
- `"yieldOvershoot"` — gusher (yield ran > 20% over target)
- `"chokedPuck"` — pressurized but flow ~0
- `"puckIntegrityGrindFine"` / `"puckIntegrityGrindCoarse"` / `"puckIntegrity"` — channeling-class warning, with grind direction when known
- `"minorIssuesGrindFine"` / `"minorIssuesGrindCoarse"` / `"minorIssues"` — caution-only

`grind.coverage` values:
- `"verified"` — the choked-puck loop saw enough pressurized samples to evaluate. Set whenever any arm produced data, including the choked / overshoot / direction cases (the verdict already carries the diagnosis; coverage just acknowledges the detector ran).
- `"notAnalyzable"` — espresso shot, non-degenerate window, but neither arm produced data (most often a simple two-marker Preinfusion + Pour profile where Arm 1's flow-mode window lies entirely before pourStart and Arm 2's pressurized-duration gate isn't met).
- `"skipped"` — non-espresso beverage or `grind_check_skip` analysis flag.
- Field absent — the pourTruncated cascade is suppressing the grind block entirely, OR the pour window is degenerate (`pourEnd <= pourStart`).

`grind.gates` exposes the inputs and thresholds the choked-puck arm (Arm 2) compared against, so consumers can answer "why didn't this badge fire?" without reading C++. Always emitted when Arm 2 ran — even on gate-fail paths. The arm has two split sub-arms (per #966):
- **Flow sub-arm** fires when `passed && meanPressurizedFlowMlPerSec < chokedFlowMaxMlPerSec`. `passed` requires `flowSamples >= minSamples && pressurizedDurationSec >= minPressurizedSec` (the original 15s ≥ 4 bar gate).
- **Yield sub-arm** fires when `flowSamples >= minSamples && yieldRatio < chokedYieldRatioMax`. Looser gate — only requires that the puck briefly saw meaningful pressure, not that the pressurized window was sustained.

Either sub-arm sets `chokedPuck = true`. The per-sample pressure floor is `minPressureBar`. The yield-overshoot arm runs in parallel without any pressurized-window gate and fires on `yieldRatio > yieldOvershootRatioMin`.

When a detector's `checked` (or `hasData`) flag is `false`, the detector was suppressed — most often by the `pourTruncated` cascade, but also by beverage-type skips (filter / pourover) or per-profile analysis flags (e.g. `flow_trend_ok`). Treat that as "no signal for this detector," not "clean signal."

The four legacy badge booleans (`channelingDetected`, `grindIssueDetected`, `skipFirstFrameDetected`, `pourTruncatedDetected`) remain available for backwards compatibility and are computed identically — `detectorResults` is a superset. The historical fifth (`temperatureUnstable`) and its `tempStability` block were removed end-to-end (see openspec change `remove-temperature-unstable-badge`).

## AI Settings Tab UI Redesign

### Current State
`SettingsAITab.qml` (602 lines) is a flat list: provider buttons → API key → provider-specific config → cost info → test connection → conversation overlay. No sections or grouping.

### New Layout: Two Sections

Reorganize into clearly labeled collapsible/visual sections:

### Implementation Details

**Section headers**: Use a reusable pattern — bold title text + 1px divider below. Same visual weight as the existing dividers but with labels. Use individual font sub-properties (`font.family: Theme.subtitleFont.family; font.pixelSize: Theme.subtitleFont.pixelSize; font.bold: true`) — do NOT combine `font: Theme.subtitleFont` with `font.bold: true` (QML property conflict).

**MCP section** (visible always, controls enabled only when `mcpEnabled` is true):

1. **Enable toggle**: `StyledSwitch` bound to `Settings.mcpEnabled` with `accessibleName` set. When off, greys out all controls below and MCP server returns 404.

2. **Description text**: Brief explanation of what MCP does, styled like the Claude recommendation banner but neutral.

3. **Access Level**: Three styled radio-like selectors in a `ColumnLayout`, each with name + description. Use the `Rectangle + AccessibleMouseArea` pattern (matching `StringBrowserPage.qml` radio pattern) styled with `Theme` values — do NOT use raw Qt `RadioButton` which renders with unstyled Material appearance. Group in a `ButtonGroup` for mutual exclusion. Bound to `Settings.mcpAccessLevel`. Disabled when MCP is off.

4. **Confirmation Level**: Same styled radio pattern. Bound to `Settings.mcpConfirmationLevel`. Disabled when MCP is off or access level is 0 (monitor-only has nothing to confirm).

5. **Status line**: Shows "Listening on port {ShotServer.port}" when enabled, "Disabled" when off. Shows active session count from `McpServer.activeSessionCount` property.

### QML Components Used
- `StyledSwitch` for the enable toggle (NOT raw `Switch`) — uses project accessibility via `accessibleName` property
- Styled `Rectangle + AccessibleMouseArea` for radio-like access/confirmation selectors (NOT raw `RadioButton`) — grouped in `ButtonGroup`
- `AccessibleButton` for all action buttons
- All text via `TranslationManager.translate()` / `Tr` component
- All styling from `Theme` singleton — no hardcoded colors, fonts, spacing, or radii
- Accessibility: every interactive element must have `Accessible.role`, `Accessible.name`, `Accessible.focusable`, and `Accessible.onPressAction` (or use `AccessibleButton`/`AccessibleMouseArea` which handle this)

### New Settings Properties in `settings.h`

```cpp
// MCP Server
Q_PROPERTY(bool mcpEnabled READ mcpEnabled WRITE setMcpEnabled NOTIFY mcpEnabledChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(int mcpAccessLevel READ mcpAccessLevel WRITE setMcpAccessLevel NOTIFY mcpAccessLevelChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(int mcpConfirmationLevel READ mcpConfirmationLevel WRITE setMcpConfirmationLevel NOTIFY mcpConfirmationLevelChanged)
```

Defaults: `mcpEnabled = false`, `mcpAccessLevel = 1` (Control), `mcpConfirmationLevel = 1` (Dangerous Only).

### McpServer QML-Visible Properties

Expose on McpServer for the status display:
```cpp
Q_PROPERTY(int activeSessionCount READ activeSessionCount NOTIFY activeSessionCountChanged)
```

**Implementation note**: The backing `m_sessions` is a `QHash` whose `size()` returns `qsizetype` (64-bit on iOS/macOS). The getter must cast safely: `return static_cast<int>(m_sessions.size())`. The `Q_PROPERTY` type stays `int` for QML binding compatibility.

Register in main.cpp context: `engine.rootContext()->setContextProperty("McpServer", &mcpServer);`

## Integration Points

### ShotServer (`src/network/shotserver.cpp`)

Add route block in `handleRequest()`:
```cpp
if (path == "/mcp" || path.startsWith("/mcp/")) {
    if (!m_mcpServer || !Settings::instance()->mcpEnabled()) {
        sendErrorResponse(socket, 404, "Not Found");
        return;
    }
    m_mcpServer->handleHttpRequest(socket, method, path, headers, body);
    return;
}
```
Add `McpServer* m_mcpServer` member + setter.

**SSE socket ownership**: For GET `/mcp` (SSE stream), ShotServer forwards the request to McpServer. McpServer takes ownership of the socket for the SSE lifetime — it removes the keep-alive timer via `m_keepAliveTimers.take(socket)` (same pattern as existing `m_sseLayoutClients` and `m_sseThemeClients` in ShotServer) and manages the socket directly. When the SSE connection closes, McpServer cleans up the socket.

**Auth for SSE streams**: Auth is validated once at connection time on the initial GET `/mcp` request (same as existing SSE endpoints for layout/theme). The `Mcp-Session` header provides session identity after the initial auth check. No periodic re-validation — if the auth cookie expires, the SSE stream stays open until it's naturally closed or the session times out.

### main.cpp (after ShotServer setup, ~line 700)
```cpp
McpServer mcpServer;
mcpServer.setDE1Device(&de1Device);
mcpServer.setMachineState(&machineState);
mcpServer.setMainController(&mainController);
mcpServer.setShotHistoryStorage(mainController.shotHistory());
mcpServer.setSettings(&settings);
mainController.shotServer()->setMcpServer(&mcpServer);
engine.rootContext()->setContextProperty("McpServer", &mcpServer);
```

### CMakeLists.txt
Add all `src/mcp/*.cpp` to SOURCES and `src/mcp/*.h` to HEADERS. Add `McpConfirmDialog.qml` to QML_FILES. No new Qt modules needed.

### ShotHistoryStorage prerequisite

The `dialing_get_context` tool requires `ShotHistoryStorage::getRecentShotsByKbId(const QString& kbId, int limit)` which does not yet exist (only referenced as a TODO comment at `shothistorystorage.cpp:649`). This must be implemented before the dial-in tools. It should:
- Follow the existing async pattern: `requestRecentShotsByKbId()` on main thread → `QThread::create()` background query → emit `recentShotsByKbIdReady()` signal
- Query: `SELECT ... FROM shots WHERE profile_kb_id = :kbId ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT :limit`
- Return summary data (not full time-series) for each shot: id, timestamp (ISO 8601 with timezone), profileName, doseG, yieldG, durationSec, enjoyment0to100, grinderSetting, temperature, notes

## Thread Safety

- **State reads** (telemetry, machine state): Direct reads of cached members — safe from any thread
- **DB queries** (shots): Use `QThread::create()` + `QPointer<QTcpSocket>` pattern (same as ShotServer)
- **Machine commands**: `QMetaObject::invokeMethod(..., Qt::QueuedConnection)` to main thread
- **Profile loads**: Must run on main thread via `invokeMethod`
- **Confirmation dialog**: `McpServer` emits `confirmationRequested` signal (arrives on main thread via queued connection). QML shows dialog. On confirm/deny/timeout, QML calls back into `McpServer::confirmationResolved(sessionId, accepted)` which invokes the stored response callback.
- **Settings reads** (access/confirmation level): Thread-safe via QSettings, cached in members with notify signals
- **Settings writes** (`settings_set`): Must dispatch to main thread via `QMetaObject::invokeMethod(..., Qt::QueuedConnection)` — `QSettings::setValue()` from a background thread is not safe when signals are connected to QML bindings

## Security

1. **Auth**: MCP routes go through existing ShotServer TOTP auth middleware
2. **Master switch**: `mcpEnabled` defaults to `false` — user must opt in
3. **Access levels**: Enforced server-side — tools not in scope return JSON-RPC error `-32603` with message "Access level insufficient"
4. **State validation**: Machine control tools verify machine is in valid state before executing (e.g., can't start espresso if not in Ready phase)
5. **Rate limiting**: Max 60 `control` + `settings` category calls/minute per session (per `RateLimitPerMinute` constant in `mcpserver.h`). Only successful calls count against the limit. Exceeded → JSON-RPC error `-32000` with message "Rate limit exceeded"
6. **Session expiry**: 30-minute inactivity timeout (per `SessionTimeoutMinutes`), cleaned during session creation
7. **SSE limits**: Max 4 concurrent MCP SSE connections
8. **Session limits**: Max 8 total MCP sessions. New connections beyond the limit receive JSON-RPC error `-32000` with message "Too many sessions"
9. **Uninitialized sessions**: Tool/resource calls before `initialize` handshake return JSON-RPC error `-32600` (Invalid Request) with message "Session not initialized"

## Discuss Shot Feature

### Overview

A "Discuss" button lets the user jump from the shot review screen (or a layout widget) to an external AI app to discuss their shot. When MCP is connected, the external AI can pull full shot context itself via `dialing_get_context`. When MCP is not connected, the app copies a formatted shot summary to the clipboard so the user can paste it.

### Settings

```cpp
// Discuss Shot
Q_PROPERTY(int discussShotApp READ discussShotApp WRITE setDiscussShotApp NOTIFY discussShotAppChanged)
Q_PROPERTY(QString discussShotCustomUrl READ discussShotCustomUrl WRITE setDiscussShotCustomUrl NOTIFY discussShotCustomUrlChanged)
```

**`discussShotApp`** (int enum):
| Value | Name | URL / Deep Link | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------------|-------|
| 0 | Claude App | `claude://` | Opens Claude Desktop app via URL scheme — best with MCP, can pull shot data directly via tools |
| 1 | Claude Web | `https://claude.ai/new` | Opens claude.ai in browser — for users without the desktop app |
| 2 | ChatGPT | `https://chatgpt.com/` | OpenAI's assistant |
| 3 | Gemini | `https://gemini.google.com/app` | Google's AI |
| 4 | Grok | `https://grok.com/` | xAI's assistant |
| 5 | Custom URL | Uses `discussShotCustomUrl` value | For self-hosted models (Ollama web UI, etc.) or any other AI service |
| 6 | None | — | Hides the Discuss button entirely |
| 7 | Claude Desktop | Uses `claudeRcSessionUrl` value | Opens a persistent Claude Code Remote Control session — requires session URL from `claude remote-control` |

Default: `0` (Claude).

**`discussShotCustomUrl`** (QString): User-entered URL for the "Custom" option. Example: `https://localhost:8080` (Ollama web UI), `https://my-ai.example.com/chat`. Default: empty.

### UI Placement: Settings

Add a **"Discuss Shot"** subsection at the bottom of the MCP section in SettingsAITab.qml (visible regardless of MCP enabled state, since this feature works both with and without MCP):

```
│ Discuss Shot                                │
│                                             │
│ Open in: [Claude            ]  ← tap to open│
│                                             │
│ Custom URL: [________________________]      │  ← only visible when "Custom URL" selected
```

Use a tap-to-open `Dialog { modal: true }` with `AccessibleButton` delegates for each option (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Custom URL). Do NOT use `StyledComboBox` or `Popup` — TalkBack cannot trap focus inside Qt Popup elements. The trigger button shows the currently selected app name. The Custom URL `StyledTextField` appears below only when "Custom URL" (index 4) is selected. The new `StyledTextField` must be appended to the existing `KeyboardAwareContainer.textFields` array in `SettingsAITab.qml` (the tab is already wrapped in `KeyboardAwareContainer`).

### UI Placement: PostShotReviewPage

Add a "Discuss" button in the bottom bar, next to the existing AI Advice button (sparkle icon). The button:
- Uses a chat/discussion icon (e.g., `qrc:/icons/discuss.svg` — speech bubble with sparkle, or similar)
- Label: "Discuss" (i18n key: `postShotReview.button.discuss`, fallback: `"Discuss"`)
- Same styling as the adjacent AI Advice button (same size, background color, icon+text pattern)

### UI Placement: ShotDetailPage

Same button in the bottom action bar, next to the existing AI Advice button. Uses the same handler logic.

### Behavior on Tap

```
1. Build shot summary text (see format below)
2. Copy to clipboard via QGuiApplication::clipboard()->setText(summary)
   — skip clipboard if MCP is enabled (the AI can pull context via tools)
3. Open the configured app URL via Qt.openUrlExternally(url)
4. Show brief toast: "Shot summary copied — paste in your AI app"
   — or if MCP enabled: "Opening AI app — it has access to your shot data"
```

### Shot Summary Clipboard Format

When MCP is not connected, the clipboard text gives the external AI enough context to be useful:

```
Espresso Shot — [Profile Name]
[DateTime]

Dose: 18.0g → Out: 36.2g (ratio 1:2.01)
Duration: 28.4s
Rating: 82/100

Bean: [Brand] [Type] (roasted [RoastDate])
Roast: [RoastLevel]
Grinder: [Brand] [Model] @ [Setting]
Burrs: [Burrs]

Notes: [espresso_notes if any]

Key metrics:
- Peak pressure: [X] bar during [phase]
- Avg flow: [X] ml/s during pouring
- Temperature: [X]°C

Please help me analyze this shot and suggest improvements for my next extraction.
```

This is built from the same shot data available on PostShotReviewPage (`editShotData`, bean/grinder fields). The `ShotSummarizer` can generate a richer version if the full shot record is available.

### Layout Widget: DiscussItem

A layout widget that opens the configured AI app to discuss the most recent shot. Works from the idle screen without navigating to shot review first.

**File**: `qml/components/layout/items/DiscussItem.qml`

**Behavior**:
- Compact mode (top/bottom bars): Icon + "Discuss" label, tap to open AI app via `AccessibleTapHandler`
- Full mode (center zones): `ActionButton` with discuss icon
- On tap: same behavior as the PostShotReviewPage button, but uses the most recent shot from `ShotHistoryStorage`
- If no shots exist yet, shows disabled state
- No secondary actions (no long-press or double-tap), so `Accessible.description` is not needed

**Registration** (3 places + sizing; historical note — the old per-surface
palette/chip lists this plan referenced were unified into one catalog table):
1. `CMakeLists.txt` — add `qml/components/layout/items/DiscussItem.qml` to QML_FILES
2. `LayoutItemDelegate.qml` — add case: `case "discuss": src = "items/DiscussItem.qml"; break`
3. `settings_network.cpp` — add a `widgetCatalogTable()` entry (palette label + chip name; drives the in-app palette, library card, and web editor)
4. `LayoutCenterZone.qml` — ensure `"discuss"` is NOT in `isAutoSized()` so it receives fixed action-button sizing (same as `history`, `espresso`, etc.)

### Key Files to Modify (Discuss Feature)

- `src/core/settings.h/cpp` — add `discussShotApp`, `discussShotCustomUrl` properties
- `qml/pages/PostShotReviewPage.qml` — add Discuss button next to AI Advice button in bottom bar
- `qml/pages/ShotDetailPage.qml` — add Discuss button next to AI Advice button
- `qml/pages/settings/SettingsAITab.qml` — add Discuss Shot subsection + append Custom URL field to `KeyboardAwareContainer.textFields`
- `qml/components/layout/LayoutItemDelegate.qml` — add "discuss" case
- `qml/components/layout/LayoutEditorZone.qml` — add to palette + chip label
- `qml/components/layout/LayoutCenterZone.qml` — ensure "discuss" gets fixed action-button sizing
- `src/network/shotserver_layout.cpp` — add to web editor widget list

### Key Files to Create (Discuss Feature)

- `qml/components/layout/items/DiscussItem.qml` — layout widget
- `resources/icons/discuss.svg` — icon (speech bubble or similar)

## Implementation Phases

### Completed

1. ~~**Settings + UI**: Add `mcpEnabled`/`mcpAccessLevel`/`mcpConfirmationLevel`/`discussShotApp`/`discussShotCustomUrl` to Settings. Reorganize SettingsAITab.qml into sections with MCP controls and Discuss Shot subsection.~~ ✅
2. ~~**Discuss Shot feature**: Add Discuss button to PostShotReviewPage and ShotDetailPage. Create DiscussItem layout widget with registration in all 5 places. Implement clipboard summary + `Qt.openUrlExternally()` flow.~~ ✅
3. ~~**Prerequisites**: Implement `ShotHistoryStorage::getRecentShotsByKbId()` for dial-in history queries.~~ ✅
4. ~~**Core protocol**: McpServer, McpSession, JSON-RPC dispatch, ShotServer route integration, CMake setup.~~ ✅
5. ~~**Read-only tools**: machine_get_state, machine_get_telemetry, shots_list, shots_get_detail, shots_compare, profiles_list, profiles_get_active, profiles_get_detail, settings_get.~~ ✅
6. ~~**Dial-in read tool**: dialing_get_context — the highest-value tool for AI dial-in conversations. Bundles shot summary, history, profile knowledge, bean metadata, and reference tables.~~ ✅
7. ~~**Machine control tools**: start/stop operations with access-level gating. Note: start commands only work on DE1 v1.0 headless machines — most machines with GHC require physical button press.~~ ✅
8. ~~**Resources + SSE**: Resource registry, subscriptions, notification wiring (especially `decenza://shots/recent` for dial-in flow).~~ ✅
9. ~~**Write tools**: shots_update, profiles_set_active, settings_set — all with access-level gating.~~ ✅
10. ~~**Polish**: Rate limiting, session cleanup, session limits, API key auth, setup page with install scripts, Claude Desktop integration, help dialog, bridge script.~~ ✅

11. ~~**Scale control tools**: `scale_tare`, `scale_timer_start`, `scale_timer_stop`, `scale_timer_reset`, `scale_get_weight`. Category: control.~~ ✅
12. ~~**Device management tools**: `devices_list`, `devices_scan`, `devices_connect_scale`, `devices_connection_status`. Category: control.~~ ✅
13. ~~**Confirmation dialog**: Hybrid confirmation system — in-app dialog for machine start operations (user is at the machine), chat-based confirmation for settings/data operations (user is at their desk). Maps to `mcpConfirmationLevel` setting (None/Dangerous Only/All Control).~~ ✅

### QML Parity — Remaining Gaps

The following QML capabilities do not yet have MCP equivalents. Organized by priority for achieving full parity as a parallel UI.

#### High Priority (needed for initial release)

14. **Profile creation**: `profiles_create` — create a new blank profile with a given editor type and title. Calls `createNewRecipe()`, `createNewPressureProfile()`, `createNewFlowProfile()`, or `createNewProfile()` depending on editor type. Category: settings.

15. **Shot management**: Replace `shots_set_feedback` with a broader `shots_update` that accepts any metadata field the QML shot editors can change (enjoyment, notes, dose, bean brand/type, roast level/date, grinder brand/model/burrs/setting, barista, TDS, EY). Add `shots_delete` for deleting individual shots. Category: settings.

16. **Brew overrides**: `machine_start_espresso` should accept optional dose/yield/temperature/grind overrides — matching the BrewDialog that QML shows before starting a shot. Calls `activateBrewWithOverrides()`. This lets MCP start a shot with specific parameters without permanently changing the profile.

#### High Priority (needed for QML parity)

16. **Full settings read/write parity**: `settings_get` and `settings_set` must cover every setting the QML Settings tabs expose. Currently only covers espresso/steam/water/DYE fields. Missing settings by tab:

**Preferences**: themeMode, darkThemeName, lightThemeName, autoSleepMinutes, postShotReviewTimeout, extractionView, smartChargingMode, keepSteamHeaterOn, steamDisabled, steamAutoFlush, refillKitOverride, perScreenScale, flowCalibration

**Connections**: savedDE1Address, savedScaleAddress, scaleType, knownScales, usbScaleEnabled

**Screensaver**: screensaverType, screensaverTimeout, screensaverBrightness, screensaverVideos

**Accessibility**: accessibilityEnabled, ttsEnabled, ttsVolume, tickSoundsEnabled, announceExtractionProgress, accessibilityExtractionInterval

**AI**: aiProvider, aiApiKey, aiModel, mcpEnabled, mcpAccessLevel, mcpConfirmationLevel, discussShotApp, discussShotCustomUrl

**History**: shotHistoryGroupBy, shotHistorySortOrder

**Data**: backup/restore operations, database stats

**Options/Steam/Water**: steamTemperature, steamTimeout, steamFlow, steamPitcherPresets, waterTemperature, waterVolume, waterVolumeMode, waterVesselPresets

**Home Automation (MQTT)**: mqttEnabled, mqttBrokerUrl, mqttTopic

**Language**: currentLanguage, availableLanguages

Each setting should use the same `Settings` property that the QML binding uses — no separate code paths.

#### Medium Priority (useful but not blocking)

17. **Visualizer integration**: `visualizer_upload` to upload a shot to visualizer.coffee, `visualizer_import` to import a profile by share code or shot ID.

18. **Profile favorites**: Read/write favorite profiles list. IdlePage shows favorites as quick-switch buttons.

19. **Advanced frame manipulation**: Individual frame operations (`addFrame`, `deleteFrame`, `moveFrame`, `setFrameProperty`). Alternative: rely on `profiles_edit_params` with full steps array (already works).

#### Low Priority (future phases)

20. **Bean inventory system**: Full CRUD for beans and batches. Requires new DB tables and significant UI work.
21. **Real-time streaming**: Subscribe/read for live sensor data during shots. Requires WebSocket or enhanced SSE.
22. **Direct control mode**: Live setpoint adjustment during shots (`setLivePressure`, `setLiveFlow`, `setLiveTemperature`).
23. **Community library**: Browse and download community-shared profiles. Complex async network flow.
24. **Backup/restore**: Create and restore database backups via MCP.

### Restructuring Proposal

Before adding new tools, consolidate existing ones to reduce tool count and avoid duplication:

#### Consolidate `dialing_apply_change` into `settings_set` + `profiles_set_active`

`dialing_apply_change` is a convenience wrapper that duplicates code from `settings_set` (temperature, weight, grinder, bean metadata) and `profiles_set_active` (profile switching). The duplication caused the advanced-profile-corruption bug (fix had to be applied in both places). Removing it simplifies the API — an AI can achieve the same result by calling the individual tools. `dialing_get_context` remains (it has unique functionality). `dialing_suggest_change` was also removed — it was a no-op stub.

**Tools removed**: `dialing_apply_change`
**Migration**: Callers use `settings_set` for temp/weight/DYE changes + `profiles_set_active` for profile switches.

#### Replace `shots_set_feedback` with `shots_update`

`shots_set_feedback` only handles enjoyment + notes, but QML can update any shot metadata field (dose, bean info, grinder info, barista, TDS, EY). Replace with a general `shots_update` that accepts any metadata field. Same underlying function (`requestUpdateShotMetadata`).

**Tools removed**: `shots_set_feedback`
**Tools added**: `shots_update` (superset), `shots_delete`

#### Net tool count change (historical, at the time of this proposal)

| Change | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Current tools | 37 |
| Remove `dialing_apply_change` | -1 |
| Remove `shots_set_feedback` | -1 |
| Add `profiles_create` | +1 |
| Add `shots_update` | +1 |
| Add `shots_delete` | +1 |
| **Subtotal at proposal time** | **38** |

After this proposal landed, additional phases added scale tools, device tools, MQTT, theme, debug log, agent file, steam health, and per-profile SAW reset. Authoritative current count: query the MCP server directly (`tools/list`) — at last verification this was **51 tools** (added `devices_reset_scale_priority`).

## Verification

1. **UI test**: Toggle MCP on/off, change access/confirmation levels, verify controls enable/disable correctly
2. **Discuss Shot test**: Tap Discuss on PostShotReviewPage → verify clipboard contains shot summary (when MCP off) → verify correct app opens. Test all 6 app options (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Custom URL, None). Test with MCP enabled → verify no clipboard copy, toast says "it has access to your shot data".
3. **Discuss layout widget test**: Add DiscussItem to a layout zone. Tap from idle screen → verify it discusses the most recent shot. Verify disabled state when no shots exist.
4. **Integration test with mcp-cli**: `npx @anthropic-ai/mcp-cli` to connect and exercise tools
5. **Access level test**: Set monitor-only, verify control tools are rejected; set control, verify settings tools rejected
6. **Confirmation test**: Set dangerous-only, trigger start espresso from AI, verify dialog appears with 15s timeout, verify async callback delivers response correctly
7. **Dial-in flow test**: Pull shot → verify SSE notification → call dialing_get_context → verify bundle contains shot summary + history + knowledge → call shots_set_feedback → verify enjoyment/notes saved
8. **Rate limit test**: Fire 11 control calls in quick succession, verify 11th is rejected
9. **Session limit test**: Open 9 sessions, verify 9th is rejected with "Too many sessions"
10. **Claude Desktop test**: Add Decenza as MCP server in config, verify tool discovery and execution
11. **Build via Qt Creator** (don't CLI-build)

## Bean Base tools and fields

- `bean_search` (read): searches the community coffee database via Visualizer's open canonical autocomplete (keyless, substring matching). Returns canonical entries (UUID shared with visualizer.coffee) enriched with origin/variety/process/roast level/tasting notes.
- `shots_get_detail` / `shots_compare` emit a parsed `beanBase` object (the shot's stored snapshot) when the shot's bean was linked; omitted otherwise.
- `shots_update` accepts a `beanBase` object — a full entry replaces the shot's snapshot, `{}` clears it (fix shots recorded against the wrong bean).
- The Bean Base API key is a sensitive credential and is NOT exposed via settings_get/settings_set.
