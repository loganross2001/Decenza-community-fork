    // under a FOREIGN_WAIT_WARN episode, naming what was delayed and how deep
    // the queue was when it finally ran.
    //
    // Queue DEPTH is deliberately not a trigger, only a payload, because the
    // app's own connect sequence is the deepest thing that ever happens here.
    // DE1Device::sendInitialSettings() enqueues five subscribes, the ready
    // marker, four reads and then its initial MMR writes, and
    // MainController::applyAllSettings() piles the profile upload on top from
    // the initialSettingsComplete signal that sequence ends with — peaking the
    // shared queue at 35 on an entirely healthy connect. That measurement, its
    // device and its composition are recorded on QUEUE_DEPTH_WARN in the header
    // rather than restated here, so there is one copy to re-derive. Any depth
    // trigger below that peak therefore fires on every single launch.
    //
    // Foreign wait does not have that problem, but its bound is narrower than
    // "quiet", and worth stating exactly because the difference is the whole
    // behaviour of this gate:
    //
    //   - It is zero while ONE device holds the queue alone, however deep the
    //     backlog, because chargeForeignWait() skips every operation whose
    //     requester matches the holder. That is the healthy-launch case above.
    //   - On a SIMULTANEOUS two-device connect it is not quiet at all, and is
    //     not meant to be. chargeForeignWait() accumulates onto every queued
    //     foreign operation, so a slow scale discovery — 6.0 s in the #1819
    //     capture — charges seconds to the whole DE1 backlog and every one of
    //     those operations clears this gate. On that connect this logs MORE
    //     than the depth gate did.
    //
    // That second case is the point rather than a regression: it is contention,
    // it is what #1819 was, and the trail is what a reader needs then. What the
    // change buys is that the loud case is now the contended one instead of
    // every launch.
    //
    // Half of FOREIGN_WAIT_WARN_MS so a reader sees the near-misses around an
    // episode, not only the operations that crossed it.
    //
    // (Fourth attempt. The first logged unconditionally — 97.8% of a 7-hour
    // device log. The second collapsed repeats but still fired on the routine
    // once-a-minute overlap of the DE1 keepalive and the scale heartbeat,
    // ~120 lines/hour. The third gated on depth >= 2 OR the foreign wait below
    // — the wait half was already right and has been live since d5b6bba6; the
    // depth half put 43 lines back into every launch. This removes the depth
    // half only, so what is new here is a deletion, not an untried trigger.
    //
    // The evidence for the deletion is a 4h17m field session on the maintainer's
    // tablet, summarised in PR #1831: 50 dispatch lines, none saying anything
    // the single WARN episode line did not. That is maintainer testimony about
    // a log nobody else holds, not a reproducible measurement — weigh it as
    // such, and do not reintroduce a depth trigger without a field log showing
    // what it would have caught.)
