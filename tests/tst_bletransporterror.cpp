// The #1658 contract, pinned at the one place that enforces it.
//
// This is the test the rest of that change was missing. tst_blecontrollererror
// covers the extracted name/classification helpers, but those were a pure
// refactor — put `emit errorOccurred(...)` back into onControllerError and every
// one of its cases still passes. The actual fix is the ABSENCE of an emit, and
// absence is exactly what a reviewer skims past and a future change silently
// undoes.
//
// The seam is real, not contrived: BleTransport's constructor only configures
// QTimers, onControllerError is null-safe on m_controller by construction
// (`m_controller ? m_controller->state() : UnconnectedState`), and
// bletransport.cpp already carries #ifndef DECENZA_TESTING guards around its
// BLEManager dependencies precisely so test targets can link it without one.
//
// The two Linux-only diagnostics in onControllerError are guarded out of test
// builds under that same #ifndef — see the comment there. Without that, the
// UnknownRemoteDeviceError rows below would emit two extra qWarnings on an
// unprivileged CI runner (failing init()'s failOnWarning) and leak a detached
// diagnostics thread into the nightly Linux ASan job. Both are invisible on
// macOS, so a green local run proves nothing about either.
