/**
 * ShotTimingController centralizes all shot timing, tare management, and weight processing.
 *
 * This eliminates the previous architecture where timing was spread across:
 * - MachineState (wall-clock timer, tare flags)
 * - MainController (DE1 BLE timer sync)
 * - ShotDataModel (raw time tracking)
 *
 * Single source of truth: DE1's BLE timer (sample.timer)
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * 1. Shot timing using DE1's BLE timer
 * 2. Tare state machine (Idle -> Pending -> Complete)
 * 3. Weight-to-timestamp synchronization
 * 4. Stop-at-weight detection
 * 5. Per-frame weight exit detection
