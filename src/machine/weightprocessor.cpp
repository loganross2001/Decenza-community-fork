    // before each shot and by resetForRetare() on mid-preheat retare.

    // loaded portafilter's weight, and one of them becomes the new baseline. The drop to
    // zero that follows then reads as a >100 g spike, so the filter rejected the app's
    // own tare. Observed every shot on-device: "Spike rejected: weight= 0 last= 364.6"
