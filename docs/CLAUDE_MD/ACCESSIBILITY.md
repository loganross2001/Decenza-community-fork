# Accessibility (TalkBack / VoiceOver)

## Current Implementation

The app has accessibility support via `AccessibilityManager` (C++) with:
- Announcements via `AccessibilityManager.announce()` — auto-routed (see "Announcement routing" below)
- Tick sounds for frame changes
- `AccessibleTapHandler` and `AccessibleMouseArea` for touch handling
- Extraction announcements (phase changes, weight milestones, periodic updates)
- User-configurable settings in Settings → Accessibility

### Announcement routing (`AccessibilityManager.announce()`)

`AccessibilityManager.announce(text, interrupt=false)` is the only announcement entry point used from QML (~25 call sites). At dispatch time it picks one of two paths automatically:

- **Platform path** — when a screen reader is judged to be RUNNING. That is `decenzaPlatformScreenReaderActive()` first (VoiceOver on macOS/iOS via `-[NSWorkspace isVoiceOverEnabled]` / `UIAccessibilityIsVoiceOverRunning()`, NVDA/JAWS on Windows via a positive `SPI_GETSCREENREADER`), falling back to `QAccessible::isActive()` where no platform answer exists — Android, where TalkBack is what activates accessibility, and Linux, where it is known to over-report. It is deliberately NOT `isActive()` alone: that reports an assistive client having ATTACHED, which is true of automation tools with no reader present, and taking it as "a reader will speak" left the app silent on macOS. The route log records which answer was used as `source=platform-probe` or `source=qt-fallback`; a silence report carrying `qt-fallback` has found its cause. Note Narrator does not set `SPI_GETSCREENREADER`, so Windows reaches the platform path through the fallback. It builds a `QAccessibleAnnouncementEvent` against the root `QQuickWindow` and posts it via `QAccessible::updateAccessibility()`. `interrupt=true` maps to `Assertive` politeness; default maps to `Polite`. **`QTextToSpeech` does not also speak in this path** — that's the bug fix that this routing replaced (we used to overlap TalkBack).
- **TTS fallback path** — when no screen reader is detected. Speaks via `QTextToSpeech` if the user has the existing `ttsEnabled` toggle on; stays silent otherwise. This preserves the "spoken extraction progress without TalkBack" use case for sighted users who want audio feedback during a shot.

There is **no user-visible delivery-mode setting**. Routing is automatic; the existing `ttsEnabled` toggle keeps its place in Settings → Language → Accessibility but only matters on the no-screen-reader fallback path.

`announcePolite(text)` / `announceAssertive(text)` are convenience wrappers that map to `announce(text, false)` / `announce(text, true)`. New call sites can use them when the politeness intent is worth being explicit; existing call sites don't need to change.

### Key QML Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `qml/components/AccessibleButton.qml` | Standard button with required `accessibleName` |
| `qml/components/AccessibleMouseArea.qml` | Custom-styled button with announce-first TalkBack behavior |
| `qml/components/AccessibleTapHandler.qml` | TapHandler variant that works with TalkBack |
| `qml/components/AccessibleLabel.qml` | Tap-to-announce text label |

### Key C++ Component

`src/core/accessibilitymanager.h/cpp` — announcement routing (platform vs TTS), tick sounds, settings persistence.

## Rule 1 — Every Interactive Element Must Be Discoverable

Every interactive element must have `Accessible.role`, `Accessible.name`, and `Accessible.focusable: true`. Without these, TalkBack/VoiceOver cannot discover or activate the element.

| Element | Preferred | If raw, must set |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Button (Rectangle+MouseArea) | `AccessibleButton` or `AccessibleMouseArea` | `Accessible.role: Accessible.Button` + `Accessible.name` + `Accessible.focusable: true` + `Accessible.onPressAction` |
| Text input | `StyledTextField` | `Accessible.role: Accessible.EditableText` + `Accessible.name` + `Accessible.description: text` + `Accessible.focusable: true` |
| Autocomplete field | `SuggestionField` | (same as text input) |
| Checkbox | Qt `CheckBox` | `Accessible.name` + `Accessible.checked: checked` + `Accessible.focusable: true` |
| Dropdown | `StyledComboBox` | `Accessible.role: Accessible.ComboBox` + `Accessible.name` (use label, not displayText) + `Accessible.focusable: true` |
| List delegate | — | `Accessible.role: Accessible.Button` + `Accessible.name` (summarize row content) + `Accessible.focusable: true` + `Accessible.onPressAction` |

```qml
// BAD - TalkBack can't see this button
Rectangle {
    MouseArea { onClicked: doSomething() }
}

// GOOD - use AccessibleButton (preferred for standard buttons)
AccessibleButton {
    text: "Save"
    accessibleName: "Save changes"
    onClicked: doSomething()
}

// GOOD - use AccessibleMouseArea (for custom-styled buttons, provides announce-first TalkBack behavior)
Rectangle {
    id: myButton
    color: Theme.primaryColor
    Accessible.ignored: true
    Text { text: "Save"; Accessible.ignored: true }
    AccessibleMouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        accessibleName: "Save changes"
        accessibleItem: myButton
        onAccessibleClicked: doSomething()
    }
}

// OK - add accessibility to Rectangle manually (last resort, loses announce-first behavior)
Rectangle {
    Accessible.role: Accessible.Button
    Accessible.name: "Save changes"
    Accessible.focusable: true
    Accessible.onPressAction: area.clicked(null)
    MouseArea { id: area; onClicked: doSomething() }
}
```

## Rule 2 — Secondary Actions Must Be Announced

Any interactive element with secondary actions (long-press, double-tap) **must** set `Accessible.description` (or `accessibleDescription` on `AccessibleTapHandler`) describing those actions. TalkBack/VoiceOver reads this as a hint after the element name. Without it, blind users cannot discover secondary workflows.

Format: `"Double-tap or long-press to <action>."` Where to set it depends on which component you're using:

| Component | How to set hint |
|-----------|----------------|
| `AccessibleTapHandler` | `accessibleDescription` property (built into the component) |
| `ActionButton` | `Accessible.description` on the button itself |
| Raw `Rectangle` + `MouseArea` | `Accessible.description` on the Rectangle |
| `AccessibleMouseArea` | `Accessible.description` on the **parent Rectangle** — `AccessibleMouseArea` does not expose an `accessibleDescription` property |

## Rule 3 — Every Page Must Have a Tab Chain (Focus Order)

Screen reader users navigate by swiping, but keyboard users (and some switch-access users) rely on `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`. Both require a logical, complete focus chain.

**Every page must:**

1. Set `activeFocusOnTab: true` on every focusable control (alongside `Accessible.focusable: true`).
2. Wire `KeyNavigation.tab` and `KeyNavigation.backtab` on all interactive controls in logical reading order, forming a **closed loop** (last element tabs back to first).
3. Set initial focus when the page/dialog becomes visible:
   - **Pages** (pushed onto `pageStack`): `Component.onCompleted: firstControl.forceActiveFocus()`
   - **Dialogs/Popups**: `onOpened: firstControl.forceActiveFocus()` — `Component.onCompleted` fires before the dialog is open and is unreliable for focus.
4. Wrap related groups of controls (e.g. a dialog's action buttons) in a `FocusScope`.

```qml
// Full pattern for a page
Item {
    Component.onCompleted: firstField.forceActiveFocus()

    StyledTextField {
        id: firstField
        activeFocusOnTab: true
        Accessible.focusable: true
        KeyNavigation.tab: secondField
        KeyNavigation.backtab: saveButton   // wraps around from last
    }

    StyledTextField {
        id: secondField
        activeFocusOnTab: true
        Accessible.focusable: true
        KeyNavigation.tab: saveButton
        KeyNavigation.backtab: firstField
    }

    AccessibleButton {
        id: saveButton
        activeFocusOnTab: true
        KeyNavigation.tab: firstField       // wraps back to start
        KeyNavigation.backtab: secondField
        onClicked: save()
    }
}

// Group related controls with FocusScope
FocusScope {
    AccessibleButton { id: okButton;     KeyNavigation.tab: cancelButton }
    AccessibleButton { id: cancelButton; KeyNavigation.tab: okButton }
}

// Repeater-based rows (e.g. preset pills) — KeyNavigation.tab can't reference
// dynamic delegates statically. Instead:
// 1. Expose focusTarget on the delegate Item
// 2. Use Keys.onTabPressed with forceActiveFocus()
// 3. Add Keys.onLeftPressed/RightPressed for arrow navigation within the row
Repeater {
    id: myRepeater
    model: myModel

    Item {
        property Item focusTarget: myPill   // expose for external callers

        Rectangle {
            id: myPill
            activeFocusOnTab: true
            Accessible.role: Accessible.Button
            Accessible.name: modelData.label
            Accessible.focusable: true
            Accessible.onPressAction: selectItem(index)

            // Non-Button Rectangle: must handle Enter/Space manually
            Keys.onReturnPressed: { selectItem(index); event.accepted = true }
            Keys.onSpacePressed:  { selectItem(index); event.accepted = true }
            Keys.onLeftPressed: {
                if (index > 0) myRepeater.itemAt(index - 1).focusTarget.forceActiveFocus()
                event.accepted = true
            }
            Keys.onRightPressed: {
                if (index < myRepeater.count - 1) myRepeater.itemAt(index + 1).focusTarget.forceActiveFocus()
                event.accepted = true
            }
            Keys.onTabPressed: {
                if (index < myRepeater.count - 1)
                    myRepeater.itemAt(index + 1).focusTarget.forceActiveFocus()
                else
                    nextControlAfterRow.forceActiveFocus()
                event.accepted = true
            }
            Keys.onBacktabPressed: {
                if (index > 0)
                    myRepeater.itemAt(index - 1).focusTarget.forceActiveFocus()
                else
                    prevControlBeforeRow.forceActiveFocus()
                event.accepted = true
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Canonical references**: `qml/pages/settings/SettingsCalibrationTab.qml` lines 710–783 (Dialog — uses `onOpened: heaterIdleTempSlider.forceActiveFocus()`, not `Component.onCompleted`). For Repeater-based pill rows, see `qml/pages/FlushPage.qml` (settings preset section).

**Canonical references**: `qml/pages/settings/SettingsCalibrationTab.qml` (Dialog focus — uses `onOpened`, not `Component.onCompleted`). For Repeater pill rows, see `qml/pages/FlushPage.qml`.

> **Priority note**: Decenza runs primarily on an Android tablet. `KeyNavigation` and `activeFocusOnTab` have no effect on TalkBack — they only benefit desktop/physical-keyboard users. Keyboard chains are **low priority** relative to TalkBack screen reader fixes, which directly impact the tablet user base.

## Anti-Patterns (Do NOT Use)

### 1. Parent-ignored / child-accessible
Never set `Accessible.ignored: true` on a parent and put `Accessible.role` on a child occupying the same bounds. TalkBack can't reliably route activation to the child. Put accessibility properties on the interactive element itself.

**Exception**: `AccessibleMouseArea` with `accessibleItem` is designed for this pattern — the parent Rectangle has `Accessible.ignored: true` and `AccessibleMouseArea` carries the accessibility properties. This is the established pattern for custom-styled buttons throughout the codebase.

### 2. Popup for selection lists
Never use `Popup` for lists users must navigate. TalkBack can't trap focus inside Qt `Popup` elements. Use `Dialog { modal: true }` with `AccessibleButton` delegates instead.

### 3. Overlapping accessible elements
Never position accessible buttons inside another accessible element's bounds (e.g., buttons inside a TextField's padding area). TalkBack will only discover one element. Use conditional layout to show buttons in separate bounds when accessibility is enabled. See `ShotHistoryPage.qml` for a real example: it checks `AccessibilityManager.enabled` to conditionally reposition elements that would otherwise overlap.

## Common Mistakes Checklist

- **Rectangle+MouseArea without accessibility** — TalkBack cannot see it. Use `AccessibleButton`, `AccessibleMouseArea`, or add all four properties (`role`, `name`, `focusable`, `onPressAction`).
- **Accessibility on raw MouseArea instead of Rectangle** — Never put `Accessible.role`/`name`/`focusable` on a raw `MouseArea` child — put them on the parent Rectangle. `AccessibleMouseArea` is the exception.
- **Missing `Accessible.onPressAction`** — Every raw Rectangle+MouseArea button **must** have `Accessible.onPressAction: mouseAreaId.clicked(null)` (or `.tapped()` for TapHandler). Without it, TalkBack/VoiceOver double-tap does nothing. Not needed for `AccessibleMouseArea` or `AccessibleButton`.
- **Child Text inside accessible button missing `Accessible.ignored: true`** — TalkBack announces button name AND text content, doubling the announcement.
- **Text input missing `Accessible.description: text`** — Field sounds "Empty" even when it contains text. `StyledTextField` and `SuggestionField` set this automatically. Note: `Accessible.value` does not exist in Qt QML — use `Accessible.description` instead.
- **ComboBox `Accessible.name` set to `displayText`** — Announces the selected value instead of the field label. Override with the label text.
- **List row with no accessibility** — Only child elements (e.g. CheckBox) are discoverable; the row itself and its primary action are invisible.
- **Decorative text without `Accessible.ignored: true`** — When a list delegate summarizes its content in `Accessible.name`, all child Text elements must set `Accessible.ignored: true`. Same applies to icon/label text inside buttons that already have `Accessible.name`.
- **Multi-action element missing `Accessible.description` hint** — Secondary actions (long-press, double-tap) are invisible to screen reader users without a hint.
- **`AccessibleTapHandler` with `accessibleItem`: child Text still needs `Accessible.ignored: true`** — When a Rectangle uses `AccessibleTapHandler` with `accessibleItem: myRect`, the TapHandler carries the accessible name on behalf of the Rectangle. Any `Text` children of that Rectangle still need `Accessible.ignored: true` — TalkBack will find both the TapHandler's name and the Text node and announce both. This applies even though the Rectangle itself has no `Accessible.name` property set directly.

**Keyboard navigation (desktop/physical keyboard only — low priority for this tablet app):**
- **Missing `activeFocusOnTab: true`** — Control is unreachable by keyboard Tab navigation even if it has `Accessible.focusable: true`. Both must be set together. Has no effect on TalkBack swipe navigation.
- **Raw Rectangle with `activeFocusOnTab` missing `Keys.onReturnPressed/SpacePressed`** — `activeFocusOnTab` gets the element focused, but a raw Rectangle won't activate on Enter/Space without explicit key handlers. Qt's `Button`-based components (`AccessibleButton`, `ActionButton`) handle this internally; raw Rectangles do not.
- **No `KeyNavigation` chain** — Focus jumps unpredictably or gets stuck for keyboard users. Has no effect on TalkBack swipe navigation.
- **`KeyNavigation.tab` on a Repeater delegate** — `KeyNavigation.tab` requires a static Item reference and cannot point to dynamically-created delegate instances. Use the `focusTarget` pattern instead (see below).
- **No initial focus** — First focusable control on a page should receive focus via `Component.onCompleted: firstControl.forceActiveFocus()`.

## Rules for New Components

1. Every interactive element must have `Accessible.role`, `Accessible.name`, `Accessible.focusable: true`, and `Accessible.onPressAction` **on itself** (not on a child). Exception: `AccessibleMouseArea` with `accessibleItem`.
2. Every interactive element with secondary actions must set `Accessible.description` describing those actions.
3. Never use `Popup` for selection lists — use `Dialog` with `AccessibleButton` delegates.
4. Never overlap accessible elements — separate bounds or check `AccessibilityManager.enabled` to conditionally reposition elements (see `ShotHistoryPage.qml` for an example).
5. Test with TalkBack: double-tap to activate, swipe to navigate.
6. *(Low priority for this tablet app)* Every focusable control should also set `activeFocusOnTab: true` for desktop/physical-keyboard users.

## Rules for Modifying Existing Components

When touching existing code, **fix pre-existing violations in the file you're modifying** — do not dismiss them as "pre-existing". Issues compound over time and each modification is an opportunity to fix them. If you add a `Text` element inside an `Accessible.name`-bearing parent and it's missing `Accessible.ignored: true`, add it.
