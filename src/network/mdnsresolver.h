/**
 * Direct mDNS client for platforms where we cannot use the system resolver for
 * what we need. Built on the header-only mjansson/mdns library.
 *
 * Two distinct jobs, with different platform coverage:
 *
 *  - resolveHostname(): ".local" hostname → IPv4. Needed on Android ONLY,
 *    because Android's stock resolver (getaddrinfo, used by
 *    QHostInfo::lookupHost) does not reliably resolve ".local" mDNS names — it
 *    returns NXDOMAIN. Everywhere else the OS resolver speaks mDNS (nss-mdns on
 *    Linux, Bonjour on macOS/iOS) and QHostInfo is the right call.
 *
 *  - browseService(): DNS-SD service enumeration. Needed on every non-Apple
 *    platform, because QHostInfo cannot browse at all — it resolves a name you
 *    already know and has no way to ask "what services are out there".
 *
 * iOS uses the system Bonjour APIs (DNSServiceBrowse), because a raw multicast
 * socket to 224.0.0.251 there requires the
 * com.apple.developer.networking.multicast entitlement, which Apple grants only
 * by per-app application. macOS builds both and DEFAULTS TO MJANSSON — it is the
 * development platform rather than a shipped one, so its default is chosen to
 * exercise what Android ships. See BrowseBackend.
 *
 * Only iOS is compiled out — `#ifndef Q_OS_IOS` below, `if(NOT IOS)` in
 * CMakeLists.txt. macOS builds BOTH backends, which is what lets it default to
 * the one Android ships. Do not narrow these guards to `NOT APPLE` — that was
 * the original shape and it removed that capability.
 *
 * Multicast reception on Android requires a held WifiManager.MulticastLock, and
 * resolveHostname()/browseService() each take one for their duration via
 * MulticastLock::Holder. Do NOT reintroduce the previous claim that ShotServer
 * holds one app-wide: that setting defaults to OFF, so on a default install
 * there was no lock at all, and every multicast answer was being dropped by the
 * Wi-Fi driver with nothing in any log to say so.

 * meant the browse path three platforms ship was never run by the only machine
 * anyone develops on. That is the asymmetry this enum was originally added to

 *

/**
 * Which local port our own mDNS queries go out from — the third selector, and

 *
 * mjansson sets the QU (unicast-response) bit unless the socket is bound to 5353.
 * A query from an ephemeral port is therefore a "legacy" query under RFC 6762
 * section 6.7, which the responder must answer by UNICAST — so the answer depends
 * on the responder being able to address this host directly. An openscale scale
 * has been measured refusing exactly that: a tablet that had never opened a
 * socket to it got zero records for hours while a Mac on the same LAN resolved it
 * in 272 ms, and a second scale on that LAN behaved oppositely toward the two
 * hosts in the same window. From 5353 the query is ordinary and the answer comes
 * back multicast, with nothing per-peer in the path. Binding 5353 with
 * SO_REUSEPORT is the openscale maintainers' recommended client-side workaround.
 *
 * Auto binds 5353 everywhere EXCEPT ANDROID, falling back to an ephemeral port
 * if that bind fails. Mdns forces 5353 with no fallback; Ephemeral forces the
 * legacy behaviour.
 *
 * ANDROID IS EXCLUDED BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DAEMON WINS THE PORT. It already owns
 * 5353; SO_REUSEPORT lets our bind succeed and then every inbound packet goes to
 * the daemon rather than to us. Measured on-device: records=0 for EVERY host,
 * including "homeassistant-chv.local", which the MQTT client needs and which
 * resolves normally from an ephemeral port. A MulticastLock was held throughout,
 * so this is not a multicast-permission problem — and in the same browse,
 * NsdManager (the daemon, on 5353) resolved a scale in 41 ms while our 5353
 * socket saw 2 records and failed.
 *
 * An earlier version of this comment called that measurement unreproducible and
 * blamed the missing MulticastLock. It reproduced exactly, the lock was not the
 * cause, and acting on that reading broke every ".local" lookup on Android —
 * scales and MQTT broker alike. Before re-enabling 5353 there, force it with
 * QueryPort::Mdns and read boundPort and recordsSeen back out of the log.
