/**
 * Checks whether a flow-controlled window's measured mean machine flow fell
 * meaningfully short of the touched frame's target flow.
 *
 * Rationale: a flow-controlled frame can carry a pressure ceiling (e.g.
 * D-Flow, D-Flow/Q). When the puck's resistance would require exceeding that
 * ceiling to hold the frame's target flow, the DE1 caps pressure instead and
 * flow falls below target for the rest of the frame. The flow branch's formula
 * up to 2.0.4 divided by the target (`weightFlow / (targetFlow * density)`),
 * so an unattained target manufactured an ideal that measured nothing about
 * pump-model accuracy (Kulitorum/Decenza#1823). That formula is gone as of v6 —
 * both control modes now use the pump-model error — but the check still
 * matters, because that error itself varies with flow RATE. A caller should
 * SKIP a window where
 * `missedTarget` is true: it measured the pump model at a rate the profile
 * does not pour at, and a single per-profile multiplier cannot describe two
 * operating points. Measured on one DE1 at a fixed multiplier, the ratio of
 * scale weight flow to reported machine flow runs 0.76 at 1.9 mL/s and 1.13
 * at 0.72 mL/s — so a capped window and a target-met window on the same
 * profile disagree by up to 48%.
 *
 * The achieved-flow (pressure-branch) formula is NOT the answer here, though
 * it was used that way between 2.0.4 and this change: it does not remove that
 * disagreement, it flips its sign (the #1872 reporter's capped window gave
 * 0.902 via the flow branch and 1.351 via the achieved-flow branch), which
 * made his multiplier oscillate with how many of the week's shots capped.
 * See `openspec/changes/skip-off-target-flow-cal-windows/`.
 *
 * Deliberately ONE-SIDED: only undershoot (`meanMachineFlow < targetFlow`)
 * can set `missedTarget`, never overshoot. A pressure ceiling can hold flow
 * BELOW its setpoint; it has no mechanism to push flow above it, so an
 * overshoot reading has no pressure-cap explanation and the window is still
 * genuinely flow-controlled — it is measuring the pump model at an operating point
 * the profile really does reach, which is the only thing this check is for.
 *
 * @param meanMachineFlow   Mean reported flow during the window (mL/s).
 * @param targetFlow        The touched frame's target flow (mL/s). Must be > 0;
 *                          returns `{false, 0.0}` for a non-positive target
 *                          (nothing to compare against).
 * @param thresholdFraction Relative undershoot above which the window is
 *                          considered pressure-capped and skipped
 *                          (e.g. 0.10 for 10%).

 * The auto-flow-cal ideal for one steady window, for BOTH control modes.

 *     ideal = currentFactor * weightFlow / (machineFlow * density)
 *
 * `machineFlow` is the DE1's REPORTED flow, which already carries
 * `currentFactor`. Dividing it back out recovers the model's own estimate, so
 * the result is the model's ERROR: water actually delivered over water the
 * model says was delivered. That is the value the stored multiplier is supposed
 * to equal. Note the DE1 has no flow meter — Decent removed it in favour of an
 * open-loop physics model over pump strokes — so this corrects a model, not a
 * sensor. Two properties follow, and both are asserted in
 * `tests/tst_autoflowcal.cpp`:
 *
 *  - It is a FIXED POINT: feeding it a machine already calibrated correctly
 *    returns the same multiplier, so a converged machine stops moving.
 *  - It is INVARIANT under `currentFactor` on a machine that servos its
 *    calibrated flow (raising the multiplier lowers delivered water, so
 *    `machineFlow` holds and `weightFlow` falls in proportion). Measured
 *    across three unrelated machines the stored multiplier moved 15-38% while
 *    this expression moved 4-15%.
 *
 * Flow-controlled windows used `weightFlow / (targetFlow * density)` until v6.
 * Why that was replaced, and why it converged on the SQUARE ROOT of the error
 * rather than the error, is in docs/CLAUDE_MD/AUTO_FLOW_CALIBRATION.md under
 * "Why the pre-v6 formula converged on sqrt(e)". It is worth reading before
 * changing this: the expression it replaced was chosen from a plausible
 * argument that the measurements do not support.
 *
 * No clamping, no guards: callers apply the window ratio guards and
 * `kCalibrationMin`/`kCalibrationMax` bounds themselves. Returns a non-finite
 * value if `machineFlow` or `density` is zero; the caller checks.
