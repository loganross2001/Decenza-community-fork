// Threading:

//     connection (see `withTempDb` in `core/dbutils.h`).
//   - `buildSawPredictionBlock` is main-thread only — it dereferences
//     `Settings*` (calibration sub-object) and `ProfileManager*` which
//     are not safe to touch from a worker thread.
//
// Empty-return contract: each builder returns an empty `QJsonObject`
// (or empty `QJsonArray`) when its preconditions don't hold, so callers
// can suppress the corresponding key entirely (no `null` placeholders).

// Issue #1158: derive the pour's control mode from the profile recipe.
// The profile JSON's `steps` array holds the frames; the dominant
// extraction frame (the one with the largest `seconds`) is the pour,
// and its `pump` field ("flow" / "pressure") is what the user targets
// during it. We read this from the recipe — NOT the runtime phase
// markers — because the markers are recorded frame transitions
// (merged/truncated at runtime) and do not reliably identify the flow
// pour: an earlier phase-marker heuristic returned "pressure" for a
// flow-controlled D-Flow / Q pour (issue #1147 follow-up). profileJson
// is available on every path that emits a shot — the dialInSessions
// loader (`loadRecentShotsByKbIdStatic` selects `profile_json`) and the
// full bestRecentShot load both carry it.
//
// Returns "flow" / "pressure", or "" when profileJson is empty,
// unparseable, has no steps, or the chosen frame has no `pump` (de1app
// / visualizer imports may lack a usable recipe) so callers keep the
// field sparse like the rest of the per-shot envelope. Sparse-omit is
// deliberate: a confidently-wrong value is worse than an absent one.
//
// This is the structured signal that lets the LLM apply the
// stop-at-weight rule in ShotSummarizer::shotAnalysisSystemPrompt(): a
// flow-controlled pour that stops at a weight target pins yield and
// makes duration ≈ stopWeight ÷ flowTarget, so neither is grind
// feedback. Without it the model only sees yieldG / durationSec on
// historical shots and reads them as dial-in outcomes (issue #1147).

// on frame-level recipe detail, so the stop-at-weight clarification is
// only needed where the recipe is presented as the current shot's spec.
// No-op when the recipe is empty or no target weight is set; phrased
