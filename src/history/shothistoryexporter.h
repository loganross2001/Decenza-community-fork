// ShotHistoryExporter mirrors shots from the SQLite DB into individual
// visualizer-format JSON files under ProfileStorage::userHistoryPath(),
// driven by Settings::exportShotsToFile.
//
// Design:
//  * Stateless when off: no tracking of "which shots have been exported."
//  * Toggle off -> on, and app startup with the toggle already on:
//    bulk pass that self-heals anything missing or out of date. Each shot's
//    existing file is kept if its mtime is >= the shot's updated_at column,
//    so a warm run with no DB changes performs no writes (and no shot-record
//    load / JSON parse, which is where the real cost lived).
//  * Toggle on: incrementally export each new shot when shotSaved fires,
//               refresh on metadata updates.
//  * Shot deletions always remove matching exported files regardless of the
//    toggle state, so files don't become orphaned if the user turns the
//    toggle off and later deletes shots from the DB.
//  * All disk and DB I/O runs on background threads.
