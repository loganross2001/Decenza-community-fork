// Collapses a repeating log line to one entry per window, carrying the count of what it stood in
// for.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS ONE CLASS
// ----------------------------
// Three unrelated periodic sources — the MMR USB-charger keepalive (60 s), the memory sampler
// (60 s) and the ShotServer request log (a 5 s browser poll) — each wanted the same behaviour, and
// each was about to grow its own copy of it. In a 48-hour tablet capture they were 3,147 + 3,107 +
// 954 lines, 35% of the entire log, and every line was near-identical to the one before it. A
// fourth copy of "remember the last text, count repeats, print a summary" is exactly the drift the
// centralize rule in CLAUDE.md is about, so it lives here and they call it.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a general log filter and NOT tied to a category: callers keep their own
// qDebug()/qWarning() and their own wording. All this decides is whether to speak.
//
// NO TIMERS
// ---------
// The window is checked against the message's own arrival, not driven by a QTimer — a suppressed
// run is flushed by the next message in that run, not by a clock. That keeps this a pure decision
// function with no ownership, no thread affinity and nothing to stop, and it is why a source that
// falls silent mid-window simply stops: its last suppressed count is folded into the next line it
// does emit. For a periodic source (which is all three callers) the difference is one line at the
// end of the run, and in exchange there is no timer to leak or fire after teardown.
class LogCollapse
{
public:
    // ON RUN ENDS, which is the one thing a caller has to get right and the thing four of six got
    // wrong.
    //
    // A source that runs for the process lifetime cannot leak — the memory sampler, the battery
    // poll. Every OTHER source eventually goes quiet, and when it does its pending tally sits in
    // the table until the next run reuses the key and prints it annotated with a span measured to
    // THAT moment: last week's repeat count on today's first line. Such a source must flush() or
    // flushAll() at whatever event ends its run.
    //
    // This was a rule in a comment on flush() and it stayed one until someone checked the callers:
    // of six, three are episodic and two of those never flushed (the MMR keepalive across a
    // disconnect, the ShotServer request log across a server stop). Both are fixed, and every
    // declaration site now states which kind it is and where it flushes.
    //
    // It is NOT a constructor mode with a destructor assert. That was built and removed: process
    // exit is not a run end anyone can observe, so an episodic source holds a legitimate tally when
    // it is destroyed, and the assert aborted on a CORRECT caller — MqttClient, which flushes on
    // every reconnect, died at teardown. With the assert gone the mode had no reader at all and the
    // compiler said so (-Wunused-private-field). An enum nobody reads is a comment with a type, so
    // this is the comment.

    // `windowMs` is the minimum spacing between emitted lines for a given key while the text is
    // unchanged. A CHANGED text always emits immediately regardless of the window — a value that
    // moved is the interesting event, and holding it back is how a collapser turns into a bug.
    explicit LogCollapse(qint64 windowMs) : m_windowMs(windowMs) {}


    // What a single emitted line stood in for. Both fields are needed to describe it honestly, and
    // they travel together for exactly that reason — see suffix().

    // for (0/0 on the first line, or when the text changed).

    // already has, and so this is testable without waiting.

    // For a periodic source there is no run end and this is never needed. For an EPISODIC one there
    // is, and without this the tally is not merely late — it is misattributed. A broker outage that
    // recovers stops calling shouldLog(), so its suppressed count sits in the table until the NEXT
    // outage prints it, stapling last week's repeat count onto today's first failure. The caller
    // that observes the recovery is the only code that knows the run ended, so it is the only place
    // that can say so.

    // contention episode touches whatever labels happened to be queued. Making each caller keep a
    // set of the keys it has used, purely so it can flush them, is the copy-per-caller this class
    // exists to prevent.

    // the tallies, which is the same misattribution as never flushing, only quieter.
