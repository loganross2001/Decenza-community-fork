# wifi-scale-discovery Specification

## Purpose
Covers on-demand mDNS discovery of the Half Decent Scale (HDS) over WiFi alongside the existing BLE scan, the WebSocket-based `DecentScaleWifi` driver that implements the `ScaleDevice` interface (weight, tare, timer, LED, status/battery/charging, button and power events), the `"wifi:<hostname>"` saved-address scheme that lets the same physical scale be selected on either transport, and the cached-IP-with-hostname-fallback and app-owned reconnect behavior that keep the WiFi connection resilient.
## Requirements
### Requirement: On-demand WiFi scale discovery

The app SHALL probe for the Half Decent Scale (HDS) on the local network only when the user initiates a device scan from the Connections page. No background, idle, or app-start probing of WiFi scales SHALL occur unless a WiFi scale is saved as the primary scale.

#### Scenario: User taps Scan for devices
- **WHEN** the user taps "Scan for devices" on the Connections page
- **THEN** the app performs an mDNS lookup of `hds.local` in parallel with the BLE scan, with a timeout of approximately 2 seconds

#### Scenario: App starts with no saved WiFi scale
- **WHEN** the app starts and the saved primary scale address does not begin with `"wifi:"`
- **THEN** the app does not perform any WiFi scale discovery

#### Scenario: App starts with a saved WiFi scale
- **WHEN** the app starts and the saved primary scale address begins with `"wifi:"`
- **THEN** the app performs a single mDNS lookup of the saved hostname with a timeout of approximately 5 seconds, and on success opens a WebSocket to the scale

#### Scenario: Saved WiFi scale unreachable on app start
- **WHEN** the app starts with a saved WiFi scale address but the mDNS lookup fails or the WebSocket fails to connect
- **THEN** the app does not auto-connect to any other scale (mirroring current BLE behavior for an unreachable saved BLE scale per #440); the user must manually rescan to recover

#### Scenario: mDNS lookup fails
- **WHEN** the mDNS lookup for `hds.local` times out or returns `HostNotFound`
- **THEN** no WiFi scale entry appears in the discovered-scales list and no error toast is shown (an offline WiFi scale is not an error)

### Requirement: WiFi scale appears in the unified scale list

The discovered-scales list SHALL contain WiFi scale entries alongside BLE scale entries, with a display-name suffix and a transport tag.

#### Scenario: WiFi scale discovered
- **WHEN** mDNS resolves `hds.local` during a user-initiated scan
- **THEN** the discovered-scales list contains an entry with `name = "Decent Scale (WiFi)"`, `address = "wifi:hds.local"`, `type = "decent-wifi"`, and `transport = "wifi"`

#### Scenario: BLE scale entries are unchanged
- **WHEN** the BLE scan discovers a Decent Scale at a MAC/UUID address
- **THEN** the discovered-scales entry retains its existing shape, with `transport = "ble"` added; the `name` field has no suffix

#### Scenario: Same physical scale on both transports
- **WHEN** the user runs a scan and both BLE and WiFi paths resolve the same physical HDS unit
- **THEN** the discovered-scales list contains two distinct rows — one BLE, one WiFi — that can each be selected independently

### Requirement: WiFi scale driver delivers weight and tare

When the user selects a WiFi scale entry, the app SHALL open a WebSocket to the scale, parse incoming JSON weight frames, and forward weight samples and tare commands through the existing `ScaleDevice` interface.

#### Scenario: Weight frame received
- **WHEN** the WiFi scale driver receives a text frame containing valid JSON `{"grams": <number>, "ms": <number>}`
- **THEN** the driver calls `setWeight(grams)`, which causes the existing weight pipeline to receive the sample with no transport-specific branching

#### Scenario: Malformed frame received
- **WHEN** the WiFi scale driver receives a text frame that is not valid JSON or lacks a numeric `grams` field
- **THEN** the driver silently ignores the frame and does not call `setWeight`

#### Scenario: Tare requested
- **WHEN** the app calls `tare()` on the WiFi scale driver
- **THEN** the driver sends the text frame `"tare"` over the WebSocket

#### Scenario: Timer commands match BLE behavior
- **WHEN** the app calls `startTimer()`, `stopTimer()`, or `resetTimer()` on the WiFi scale driver
- **THEN** the driver sends the text frame `"timer start"`, `"timer stop"`, or `"timer reset"` respectively over the WebSocket

#### Scenario: Display commands match BLE behavior
- **WHEN** the app calls `disableLcd()` on the WiFi scale driver
- **THEN** the driver sends the text frame `"display off"` over the WebSocket

- **WHEN** the app calls `wake()` on the WiFi scale driver
- **THEN** the driver sends `"soft_sleep off"` followed by `"display on"`, in that order

#### Scenario: Sleep command matches BLE intent (reversible scale-side sleep)
- **WHEN** the app calls `sleep()` on the WiFi scale driver
- **THEN** the driver sends `"soft_sleep on"` and emits `sleepCompleted` once after `sendTextMessage` returns; the driver does NOT send `"power off"` (which would be irreversible)

#### Scenario: LED control matches BLE behavior with clamping
- **WHEN** the app calls `setLed(r, g, b)` on the WiFi scale driver with each channel in 0-255
- **THEN** the driver sends `"led <r> <g> <b>"` with the integer values

- **WHEN** the app calls `setLed(r, g, b)` with channels outside 0-255
- **THEN** each channel is clamped to 0-255 before formatting the text command

#### Scenario: sendKeepAlive is a no-op
- **WHEN** the base-class 30 s keepalive timer fires on the WiFi scale driver
- **THEN** the driver does nothing (the 5 s status heartbeat from the scale plus TCP keepalive provide liveness)

### Requirement: Transport switching for the same physical scale

The user SHALL be able to switch between BLE and WiFi transports for the same physical scale by selecting the alternative entry in the discovered-scales list.

#### Scenario: User switches from BLE to WiFi
- **WHEN** the BLE Decent Scale is currently connected, and the user selects the "Decent Scale (WiFi)" row
- **THEN** the BLE connection is disconnected, the WiFi WebSocket opens, and weight samples begin arriving from the WiFi transport

#### Scenario: User switches from WiFi to BLE
- **WHEN** the WiFi Decent Scale is currently connected, and the user selects the BLE Decent Scale row
- **THEN** the WiFi WebSocket is closed (so the scale becomes available to other clients), the BLE connection opens, and weight samples begin arriving from the BLE transport

### Requirement: Saved-scale address scheme distinguishes transports

The saved primary scale address SHALL encode the transport so that BLE and WiFi entries for the same physical scale do not collide on the saved-address comparison.

#### Scenario: WiFi scale is saved
- **WHEN** the user connects to a WiFi scale entry
- **THEN** the saved primary scale address is `"wifi:<hostname>"` (e.g., `"wifi:hds.local"`)

#### Scenario: BLE scale is saved
- **WHEN** the user connects to a BLE scale entry
- **THEN** the saved primary scale address is the BLE MAC or UUID, unchanged from current behavior (no `"ble:"` prefix is added — bare addresses denote BLE for backwards compatibility)

#### Scenario: Primary-only auto-reconnect honors transport
- **WHEN** the saved primary scale address is `"wifi:hds.local"` and a BLE scan discovers a Decent Scale at a MAC address
- **THEN** the BLE entry does not auto-connect (the saved address does not match)

### Requirement: Concurrent-client-cap server-busy condition surfaces clearly

When the scale's firmware refuses a WebSocket upgrade because the concurrent-client cap is exceeded (HTTP 503 per the firmware behavior in `webserver.h` — current cap is 5 clients), the app SHALL surface a specific, user-readable error and NOT loop retry attempts.

#### Scenario: Scale is at the concurrent-client cap
- **WHEN** the WiFi scale driver attempts to open the WebSocket and the server returns 503
- **THEN** the driver emits the error message "Another client is connected to the scale" and stops attempting to connect

### Requirement: Reconnect on transient drop is owned by the app-level reconnect loop

The WiFi driver SHALL NOT schedule reconnect attempts internally. On WebSocket `disconnected`, the driver calls `setConnected(false)` and returns. The app-level reconnect loop in `main.cpp` (the `scaleReconnectTimer`, gated on `settings.scaleAddress()` being non-empty) owns retry orchestration via `BLEManager::tryDirectConnectToScale()` → `DecentScaleWifi::connectToHost()`.

#### Scenario: WebSocket disconnects mid-stream
- **WHEN** the WiFi WebSocket emits `disconnected` after having been connected
- **THEN** the driver propagates the disconnect via `setConnected(false)` and does NOT schedule its own reconnect; the app-level `scaleReconnectTimer` schedules the retry

#### Scenario: Reconnect also fails
- **WHEN** the app-level reconnect re-fires `connectToHost()` and that attempt also disconnects
- **THEN** the driver again propagates `setConnected(false)`; the app-level retry loop applies its exponential-backoff schedule (5 s / 30 s / 60 s) before the next attempt

### Requirement: Weight pipeline auto-adapts to WiFi cadence

The app SHALL NOT introduce transport-specific cadence thresholds, capability handshakes, or version negotiation. The existing per-connection inter-arrival EMA in `WeightProcessor` provides cadence adaptation for any rate within the existing stall thresholds (`kScaleStaleMs = 2000`, `kScaleStallConfirmMs = 6000`).

#### Scenario: Firmware emits at 2 Hz
- **WHEN** the WiFi scale firmware emits weight frames every 500 ms
- **THEN** the weight pipeline absorbs the cadence without stalling and computes flow-rate / SAW signals using the measured interval

#### Scenario: Firmware emits at 10 Hz
- **WHEN** the WiFi scale firmware emits weight frames every 100 ms
- **THEN** the weight pipeline absorbs the cadence without code changes, with the inter-arrival EMA tracking the new rate within ~3-5 samples

#### Scenario: Firmware cadence changes mid-session
- **WHEN** the firmware is updated to a different cadence while a session is in progress (e.g., via OTA — not in scope here but the pipeline must tolerate it)
- **THEN** the inter-arrival EMA reconverges to the new rate without requiring a reconnect or any user action

### Requirement: Connect-time setup sends `rate 10k` and `events on`

When the WebSocket connection establishes, the driver SHALL request the highest supported cadence and opt in to event frames. No retries are needed; if the firmware does not understand a command it ignores it.

#### Scenario: Driver connects to WiFi scale
- **WHEN** the WebSocket `connected` signal fires
- **THEN** the driver sends `"rate 10k"` and then `"events on"` as two text frames, in that order

#### Scenario: Driver seeds initial status
- **WHEN** the driver has sent `"rate 10k"` and `"events on"` on connect
- **THEN** the driver also sends `"status"` to seed an immediate status frame so battery, charging, and firmware_version populate without waiting for the 5 s periodic heartbeat

### Requirement: Status frame readbacks

The driver SHALL parse incoming `type: "status"` frames and surface their readback fields through the existing `ScaleDevice` interface plus the new `charging` property.

#### Scenario: Battery percent updates
- **WHEN** a status frame arrives with `battery_percent: <0..100>`
- **THEN** the driver calls `setBatteryLevel(<value>)`

#### Scenario: Charging state updates
- **WHEN** a status frame arrives with `charging: true` (or `false`)
- **THEN** the driver calls `setCharging(true)` (or `false`); the `chargingChanged` signal fires only when the value flips

#### Scenario: Firmware version logged on first capture
- **WHEN** a status frame arrives with `firmware_version: "<string>"` for the first time on a given connection
- **THEN** the driver logs the version once via `logMessage`; subsequent status frames with the same value do NOT re-log

#### Scenario: Firmware version change mid-connect
- **WHEN** a status frame arrives with a `firmware_version` value different from one previously captured on the same connection
- **THEN** the driver warn-logs the transition (matches BLE driver behavior)

#### Scenario: Firmware version cleared on disconnect
- **WHEN** the WebSocket disconnects
- **THEN** the captured firmware_version is cleared so the next connect re-logs it fresh

#### Scenario: Unknown or renamed status fields are tolerated
- **WHEN** a status frame contains fields the driver does not consume (e.g., `timer_seconds`, `timer_ms`, `led`, `display_on`, `low_power`, `soft_sleep`, `events_enabled`, `rate_hz`, `interval_ms`, or future additive fields)
- **THEN** the driver ignores them without error; missing fields the driver might expect (e.g., a status frame from a transitional firmware that lacks `firmware_version`) are also tolerated — the driver does not crash, log loudly, or skip the otherwise-valid frame

### Requirement: Charging state is a first-class ScaleDevice property

The `ScaleDevice` base class SHALL expose `charging` as a `Q_PROPERTY` independent of battery level so the WiFi driver's explicit boolean is not downgraded into the lossy "battery == 100" overload that BLE has historically used.

#### Scenario: WiFi reports charging explicitly
- **WHEN** the WiFi scale driver receives a status frame with `battery_percent: 82, charging: true`
- **THEN** `setBatteryLevel(82)` and `setCharging(true)` are called as independent updates; consumers of the `charging` property see `true` while `batteryLevel` reads `82`

#### Scenario: BLE driver also surfaces charging correctly
- **WHEN** the BLE Decent Scale driver receives an LED-response packet with battery byte `0xFF`
- **THEN** the driver calls `setCharging(true)` AND `setBatteryLevel(100)` — both, not just the battery level — so the new `charging` property correctly reflects charging state on BLE-connected scales

### Requirement: Button events emit `buttonPressed` with a non-colliding encoding

The WiFi driver SHALL emit `buttonPressed(int)` for scale-side button events, using an encoding that cannot collide with the 0..255 range BLE uses for its single-byte button id.

#### Scenario: Circle short-press over WiFi
- **WHEN** a button frame arrives with `button_number: 1, press_code: 1` after `events on`
- **THEN** the driver emits `buttonPressed(0x1101)`

#### Scenario: Square long-press over WiFi
- **WHEN** a button frame arrives with `button_number: 2, press_code: 2` after `events on`
- **THEN** the driver emits `buttonPressed(0x1202)`

#### Scenario: BLE button values are not affected
- **WHEN** the BLE driver receives a button command (`0xAA`) with byte `[2]` in the 0..255 range
- **THEN** the BLE driver continues to emit `buttonPressed(<raw byte>)` with values in 0..255 — no encoding change on the BLE side

### Requirement: Power events are surfaced and suppress reconnect

The WiFi driver SHALL handle `type: "power"` events as expected disconnects, log the human-readable reason, and SHALL NOT trigger the 3 s reconnect attempt that applies to unexpected disconnects.

#### Scenario: Scale powers off due to low battery
- **WHEN** a power event arrives with `event: "power_off", reason: "low_battery", reason_code: 3` shortly followed by the WebSocket disconnecting
- **THEN** the driver logs the reason ("Scale shut down: low battery"), does NOT schedule a reconnect, and the subsequent `disconnected()` is treated as expected

#### Scenario: Unexpected disconnect (no preceding power event)
- **WHEN** the WebSocket disconnects without a preceding power event
- **THEN** the driver schedules exactly one reconnect attempt approximately 3 seconds later

### Requirement: WiFi connect tries cached IP first with hostname fallback

To make WiFi reconnect robust against unreliable mDNS resolution, the WiFi driver SHALL cache the resolved peer IP after each successful connection, attempt the cached IP on subsequent connects, and fall back to the hostname when the cached IP does not deliver a recognizable HDS frame within a short window.

#### Scenario: First connect by hostname caches the peer IP
- **WHEN** the driver opens a WebSocket using the hostname (no cached IP available) and receives the first snapshot or status frame within the recognition window
- **THEN** the driver writes the WebSocket peer address into the IP cache, keyed by hostname, so subsequent connects can skip mDNS

#### Scenario: Subsequent connect tries the cached IP first
- **WHEN** a previously cached IP exists for the saved hostname and the driver is asked to connect
- **THEN** the driver opens the WebSocket against `ws://<cached-ip>/snapshot` first, without performing a hostname resolution

#### Scenario: Cached IP succeeds — no mDNS lookup performed
- **WHEN** the cached IP responds with a recognizable HDS frame (snapshot or `type:"status"`) within the 5 s recognition window
- **THEN** the driver treats the connection as established and does not attempt to resolve the hostname

#### Scenario: Cached IP fails recognition — fall back to hostname
- **WHEN** the cached IP attempt opens the WebSocket but no recognizable HDS frame arrives within 5 s (e.g., DHCP reassigned the IP to a different host running a WebSocket server)
- **THEN** the driver closes the cached-IP socket and retries via `ws://<hostname>/snapshot`; on success, the cache is overwritten with the new peer IP

#### Scenario: Cached IP refuses connection — fall back to hostname
- **WHEN** the cached IP attempt fails at the TCP layer (refused / unreachable / timed out before WS upgrade)
- **THEN** the driver retries via the hostname, same as the recognition-timeout fallback

#### Scenario: Both cached IP and hostname fail
- **WHEN** both attempts time out their recognition windows or fail to connect
- **THEN** the driver emits `errorOccurred("WiFi scale did not respond as HDS")` and stops; no further retries on this connect cycle. The user can rescan to retry.

### Requirement: Rate command behavior under weak WiFi is opaque to the driver

The driver SHALL request `rate 10k` on connect and SHALL NOT attempt to downgrade the requested rate if frames arrive less frequently than expected. The firmware drops frames it cannot send rather than queueing them, so the weight pipeline's existing inter-arrival EMA absorbs any variance.

#### Scenario: WiFi link is weak
- **WHEN** the firmware skips a write tick because the socket is not writable
- **THEN** the driver receives a frame later than the requested interval; the weight pipeline's EMA tracks the actual cadence and does not trigger spurious stalls so long as gaps stay under `kScaleStaleMs` (2 s)
