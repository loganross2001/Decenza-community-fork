# Logging

How to log so the line is findable later. Read this before adding a log line to a
first-party runtime path, and before creating a new subsystem.

Decenza's device problems are diagnosed **after the fact, from a log a user
uploaded**, usually with the user's own AI assistant reading it over MCP. You will
not have the hardware, the network, or a second chance to ask. That single fact
drives everything below.

## The two properties every log line must have

**1. One grep returns the whole subsystem.** A line begins with its subsystem's
bracketed marker, then optionally its own source:

```
[Scale][BLE AcaiaScale] Reporting connected (weight frame)
[DE1][Serial] Port opened: cu.usbmodem1234 (115200 8N1)
[Bluetooth][BLEManager] Adapter recovered — re-arming DE1 + scale reconnect
```

So `grep '\[Scale\]'` returns every scale line — drivers, transports, discovery,
USB, WiFi — and nothing else. This only works if it holds for **every** line. One
site with a hand-rolled prefix is invisible to the search *and* the reader cannot
tell it was missed, because the log looks complete. That is why it is
[machine-checked](#enforcement), not merely documented.

**2. Severity carries audience.** Pick a tier by **who needs the line**, not by how
important it feels:

| Tier | Audience | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `DEBUG` | developers | protocol frames, per-poll state, parse internals, "why this no-op'd" |
| `INFO` | **users** | lifecycle, discovery outcomes, connect/disconnect, transport choice and fallback, scheduling |
| `WARN`+ | problems | failures, timeouts, unreachable peers, rejected data, refused operations |

This is what makes `marker + minLevel INFO` a complete, self-contained answer. The
app's connections-page views run exactly that query, and so does `debug_get_log`, so
**the tier you choose decides whether a user ever sees the line.**

Audience, not authorship: a low-level driver logs INFO when its event is part of the
user-facing story, and a high-level manager logs DEBUG when the detail only serves a
developer. Both directions of mistake are silent — a user-facing line left at DEBUG
vanishes from its view, and driver chatter promoted to INFO puts the firehose back on
screen.

## Adding a log line

Call your subsystem's helper. Never `qDebug()` directly, and never type a marker into
the message.

```cpp
// src/ble/scales/acaiascale.cpp — aliases at the top of the file
#define ACAIA_LOG(msg)  SCALE_LOG("AcaiaScale", msg)
#define ACAIA_INFO(msg) SCALE_INFO("AcaiaScale", msg)
#define ACAIA_WARN(msg) SCALE_WARN("AcaiaScale", msg)

ACAIA_INFO(DECENZA_BLE_MSG_CONNECTED("weight frame"));
ACAIA_LOG(QStringLiteral("Notify enabled on %1").arg(uuid.toString()));
```

The helper headers, one per subsystem:

| Subsystem | Header | Macro family | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[Scale]` | `src/ble/scales/scalelogging.h` | `SCALE_LOG/INFO/WARN` | short form tags `"BLE <prefix>"`; `*_TAGGED` takes the tag verbatim |
| `[DE1]` | `src/ble/de1logging.h` | `DE1_LOG/INFO/WARN_TAGGED` | |
| `[Refractometer]` | `src/ble/refractometers/refractometerlogging.h` | `REFRACTOMETER_LOG/INFO/WARN` | same `"BLE "` short form |
| `[Bluetooth]` | `src/ble/bluetoothlogging.h` | `BT_LOG/INFO/WARN_TAGGED` | **stderr-only by construction** — nothing here has a `logMessage`, so there is no `BT_*_STDERR_TAGGED` and `BT_*_TAGGED` does not emit |
| `[SAW]` | `src/machine/sawlogging.h` | `SAW_{LOG,INFO,WARN}_{TAGGED,STDERR}` | mostly stderr in practice — SAW lives in controllers, a settings store and a worker thread, none of which carry `logMessage` |
| `[Font]` | `src/core/fontlogging.h` | `FONT_{LOG,INFO,WARN}_STDERR` | stderr-only by construction — font setup runs before any object with a `logMessage` exists |
| `[Network]` | `src/core/networklogging.h` | `NETWORK_{LOG,INFO,WARN}_{TAGGED,STDERR}` | reachability; app servers also use the registered `DIAG_*` helpers with the Network owner |
| `[Screensaver]` | `src/screensaver/screensaverlogging.h` | `SCREENSAVER_{LOG,INFO,WARN}_{TAGGED,STDERR}` | |
| `[Theme]` | `src/core/themelogging.h` | `THEME_{LOG,INFO,WARN}_{TAGGED,STDERR}` | appearance: themes, colours, backgrounds, font SIZES (vs `[Font]`, which is which family resolved) |

The specialized families above stop at `WARN`. The general `DIAG_ERROR` and
`DIAG_FATAL` helpers also preserve a registered marker for critical/fatal events.
Choose severity for the actual outcome; ordinary request failures use WARN.

**Alias the macro, never copy its body.** `difluidr1.cpp` and `difluidr2.cpp` each
hand-copied `SCALE_LOG`'s body once, so a one-line fix to the shared macro had to be
found and applied in three places, and the two copies were identical only by luck.

### Which variant

- **`*_TAGGED(tag, msg)`** — the normal form. `tag` names the source and is a string
  literal.
- **`*_STDERR_TAGGED`** — for code with no `logMessage` signal in scope: free
  functions, static helpers, JNI shims, simulators. Also for a `const` member
  function: `DECENZA_SUBSYS_LOG` emits as well as writing, and our `logMessage`
  signals are declared non-const (`de1device.h:361`), so `emit` will not compile
  there. (moc itself is fine with a const signal — it const_casts `this`,
  `qtbase/src/tools/moc/generator.cpp:1297-1300` — so the limit is our declaration.
  This note previously blamed moc, uncited and wrongly.)
- **`*_STDERR_DYN(tag, msg)`** — only when one helper logs on behalf of several
  sources, so a hard-coded tag would name the wrong one. `BLEManager`'s scale and
  refractometer tiers use it because `main.cpp` drives the reconnect ladders and its
  lines must not be stamped `BLEManager`.

### Use the canonical wording for shared events

Thirteen scale drivers and two refractometers report the same handful of events. Use
`DECENZA_BLE_MSG_*` (in `core/logtags.h`) rather than typing the message, so
comparing two models' logs does not start with working out whether "First weight
received, marking as connected" and "Scale confirmed working, reporting connected"
are the same thing. (They were.)

Anything genuinely model-specific — which characteristic, which extra notification —
stays a literal at the call site.

### A periodic line that says nothing must say nothing

A line whose text is unchanged carries no more information an hour later than it did
a minute later, so the question is not how often it may repeat — it is whether the
repeat is worth a line at all. For a source reporting that things are normal, it is
not. Route it through `LogCollapse` constructed with `LogCollapse::kChangesOnly`
(`src/core/logcollapse.h`): a CHANGE prints at once and carries the count of
identical lines it stood for, and nothing prints in between.

The MMR charger keepalive, meaningful memory growth, battery/forecast results,
ShotServer requests, MQTT retries and elided-write lines use it. Repeated connection
failures also use it; changing a repeat counter or moving a line to DEBUG is not
suppression. A finite window is for the one case where the repeat is
itself evidence: `BleGattQueue`'s dispatch line only speaks above a foreign-wait
threshold, and a window is what separates two operations inside one stall.

Two things to get right, both of which have been got wrong here:

- **An episodic source must flush at its run end**, or its pending tally is stapled
  onto the next run's first line hours later with a span dated to now. Periodic
  sources need no flush — the tally rides out on the next line whose text differs.
- **Key it by what makes two lines the same event.** The elided-write lines key on
  the whole message, so a different CALLER eliding the same value still prints:
  "who tried and was ignored" is the entire content of that line.

## Four failure modes to avoid

These are the ones that actually happened, repeatedly.

**Don't write the same event twice.** One call per event. The shape to recognise is a
`qDebug()` next to an `emit`/helper call describing the same thing:

```cpp
// WRONG — and it drifts. At 21 USB sites these two ended up describing
// the same event in DIFFERENT WORDS, so neither was redundant and neither
// was complete.
qDebug() << "BLEManager: Direct wake (WiFi) - connecting to" << hostname;
scaleInfo(QStringLiteral("Direct wake (WiFi): connecting to %1").arg(hostname));
```

Put everything in one marked line. If two sinks seem to need different text, the
sinks are the problem, not the wording.

**Don't warn about something that is not wrong.** A `WARN` that fires on a working
configuration trains readers to skim the tier that means "look here". Real examples
removed from this codebase: a successful cache rehydrate warning on *every* launch of
every affected device; "no DE1 found" warning while the user was deliberately running
the simulator. If a retry ladder repeats a failure forever, emit its first occurrence and
suppress identical repeats — see `BLEManager::scaleRepeatFailure`. Keep distinct
failures independent, and re-arm on recovery or a fresh user attempt. The ending
episode records its repeat count once; it does not emit DEBUG on every retry.

**Don't report a transition that did not happen.** Guard on state. An unconditional
"disconnected" logs a disconnect for a device that never connected, which reads as
the app having just lost hardware. `DECENZA_BLE_MSG_INCOMPLETE_SUFFIX(ready)` exists
because "the link dropped after working" and "the connect never reached ready" arrive
through the same callback and are different diagnoses.

**Don't announce an intent as if it were an outcome.** A line that says what the code
is *about to try*, at a tier where the failure of that attempt is not visible, is worse
than silence: it reads as a complete account and the reader draws the wrong conclusion
with nothing to signal that anything is missing.

The WiFi scale did exactly this. At INFO the log said

```
[Scale][BLE DecentScaleWifi] Previous attempt found hds.local unreachable — re-resolving before retry
[Scale][BLE DecentScaleWifi] WebSocket error: Host unreachable — target=192.168.10.145
```

for eight minutes against one unchanging address. The truth was that resolution had
failed and the driver had fallen back to the *cached* address — a line that existed,
at DEBUG. So the narrative asserted a fresh resolve that never happened, and a scale
that had simply moved read as a scale that was switched off.

Two fixes, and prefer the second: defer the line until the branch is known, or put the
outcome on the line that already reports the result. Here the failure line already
printed `target=`; it gained *where that address came from*. Note what the tempting fix
would have cost — promoting the fallback line to INFO adds one line per retry cycle
forever to correct one line that should not have been at INFO. **Fixing a
dishonest line by adding a second line is usually the wrong direction.**

## Adding a subsystem

Two edits in `src/core/logtags.h`:

1. A `DECENZA_LOG_MARKER_<NAME>` literal.
2. A row in `DECENZA_LOG_SUBSYSTEMS(X)` — marker plus a description **written for
   someone who has never read the code**, because it reaches the `debug_get_log` tool
   description verbatim.

Then a helper header aliasing `DECENZA_SUBSYS_LOG*` for the new marker, following one
of the four above. Do not restate the marker list anywhere else: the MCP description
and `scripts/check_log_markers.py` both derive from the registry, and a copy is free
to drift.

A marker is a **published name**. Renaming one breaks every saved query, filter and
habit built on it. Treat it as API.

**Split a subsystem out when it answers a different question.** `[Refractometer]` is
separate from `[Scale]` even though refractometers run on the scale BLE transports
and appear in the same view, because "my TDS reading is wrong" and "my weight is
wrong" are diagnosed from different lines. `[Bluetooth]` is separate from both because
it sits *beneath* them — when the adapter is wedged neither device can connect, and
filing that under one of them sends a reader hunting a fault in the wrong place.

**The test is the question, not the hardware.** `[SAW]` is registered even though
stop-at-weight owns no device, because "why did my shot stop where it did" is a
different question from "did the weight readings arrive" — different code, different
fault, and a reader sent to the wrong one wastes the whole investigation. Registration
is open to any subsystem whose lines are retrieved as a group; being a driver is not
the entry requirement. (`#1707` left this open as "shot logic, not a device", which
framed it as a question about ownership. It is not.)

The same test cuts the other way in the same file. `weightprocessor.cpp` is SAW's
worker, but its feed-liveness, stall and interval lines carry **`[Scale]`**, because
they answer whether the readings arrived. Two markers in one file is correct when the
file answers two questions; what is never correct is a third, unregistered prefix —
which is what `[Weight-Worker]` was.

**Don't let one subsystem claim a shared resource.** One `QBluetoothDeviceDiscoveryAgent`
serves the DE1, the scales and the refractometers. Logging its scan lifecycle under
`[DE1]` made a `[DE1]` filter read "looked for the machine, gave up" when the scan was
actually a WiFi-to-BLE *scale* fallback that succeeded. The event belongs to whoever
asked for it, or to nobody.

## Retrieving a subsystem's story

From a checkout, over a shared log:

```bash
grep '\[Scale\]' debug.log            # the whole scale narrative
grep -E '\[(Scale|Refractometer)\]' debug.log   # what the connections view shows
```

Over MCP, which is how a user's assistant reads it:

```
debug_get_log  session=-1  filter="[Scale]"  minLevel="INFO"
```

**`filter` is a substring — leave `regex` off.** Under `regex: true`, `[Scale]` is a
character class matching any line containing S, c, a, l or e, i.e. nearly every line.
It looks like a working query returning everything.

`session=-1` scopes to the current run. Without it you get every session in the file,
and a scale connecting and disconnecting yesterday looks like it happened just now.

## Session boundaries, and what a trim may not do

A `SESSION START` marker asserts **when the session whose lines follow it began**, and
is written only at that moment. Nothing else may write one — in particular no
maintenance of the file, because the only start time such code holds is the *current*
run's, while the lines it would be introducing belong to an older one.

That is not a hypothetical rule. `trimLogFile()` used to re-emit a marker stamped with
the running session's start at the head of the surviving (older) content, "so it
survives the trim". Since the index treats every `SESSION START` as a boundary, the
forgery became a real session in every enumeration:

```
idx 0  3249 lines  2026-07-29T18:17   <- forged by a trim
idx 1  9089 lines  2026-07-28T10:23
idx 2  5526 lines  2026-07-29T08:21
idx 3  2852 lines  2026-07-29T18:17   <- the real one
idx 4  1297 lines  2026-07-30T08:20
```

Two sessions claiming one timestamp, an enumeration not in chronological order, every
`session=N` off by one, and yesterday's lines dated to this morning — the exact hazard
`session=-1` is documented above as protecting you from, reintroduced beneath the
guidance by the thing writing the log.

**A trim writes a banner and nothing else.** The concern the old code named is real —
a trim *can* remove the running session's own marker, if that session alone exceeds
the keep size — and it is handled where it belongs, in the reader: a leading fragment
with no marker of its own is reported as a session with an **unknown** start
(`timestamp: null`, `startTimeKnown: false`), not one borrowed from a neighbour. An
absent timestamp is recoverable by a reader; a wrong one is not.

Two traps if you touch this code:

- The marker is written with a **leading newline**, so line 0 of a perfectly healthy
  fresh log is blank and the marker is on line 1. A headless-fragment test of "line 0
  is not a marker" invents a phantom one-blank-line session on every new log — the
  same defect class. Require a non-blank line before the first marker.
- **And skip the trim banner**, which `trimLogFile()` writes unconditionally. A trim
  landing just before a marker leaves banner-then-marker with nothing orphaned, and
  counting the banner reported a session whose entire content was the banner. That
  shipped in the first cut of this fix and its own tests missed it, because every
  fixture put a real orphaned line after the banner.
- `debug_get_log` reports an unknown start as JSON `null` plus a flag and a reason,
  never as `""`. An empty string reads as a parse failure in the tool and sends the
  reader looking for a bug there instead of understanding that the information was
  destroyed before they arrived.

## Where the log goes

`WebDebugLogger` (`src/network/webdebuglogger.h`) installs the Qt message handler,
keeps an in-memory ring buffer for the web poller, and appends every line to
`debug.log` (capped at `MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE`, trimmed from the front, with a
`========== SESSION START` marker per run).

There is **one** log. The connections page's two views are filtered reads of it via
`WebDebugLogger::sessionLinesMatching()`, and Share sends the same file. If you find
yourself building a second buffer so some screen can show something, you are
recreating the private `scale_debug_log.txt` channel that was deleted: it was capped,
it duplicated lines already on disk, it omitted every other subsystem, and everything
routed *only* through it was absent from every log a user ever submitted.

Adding a view? Use `SubsystemLogView.qml` with a `markers` list. It backfills through
`sessionLinesMatching()` and follows `lineAppended`, and both use the same predicate
so what it shows on arrival matches what a reload shows.

**A slot connected to `lineAppended` must not log.** Doing so re-enters the global
message handler from inside its own emit. There is a per-thread guard against the
recursion, but the guard's cost is dropping that line's signal — so a stray
`console.log` in a view's append handler silently makes the view miss lines.

## Shared application logging

Use `core/diagnosticlogging.h` for application owners without a specialized helper:

```cpp
DIAG_INFO(BATTERY, "BatteryManager") << "requesting charge enable";
DIAG_WARN(STORAGE, "ShotHistoryStorage") << "shotId=" << shotId << "result=missingRow";
```

QML and module JavaScript use the compile-time `Decenza.WebDebugLogger` singleton
(`WebDebugLogger` with a normal `import Decenza`):

```qml
WebDebugLogger.warn("Recipes", "RecipesItem", "Start blocked: machine not ready")
```

The registry and prefix formatter in `logtags.h` serve both paths. Ownership belongs
to the operation, so a mixed file can use several owners. Bag fetch, archive,
extraction and product-page search belong to BeanBase, including provider callbacks;
general advice and conversations belong to AI. Storage owns database CRUD, backups,
restores and migrations. Network includes ShotServer and MQTT; Visualizer has its own
owner. The live catalog contains the complete list.

Android's `DiagnosticLog` bridge sends each runtime record through Qt once the logger
is installed. Before Qt is available, receivers and services write prefixed logcat
lines only. Uncaught-exception handlers and crash-report writers retain their
crash-safe paths; those files and logcat are separate from the persisted Qt log.
The terminal console sink must never call Qt logging recursively.

## Runtime context and physical lines

`WebDebugLogger` preserves supplied category and portable file/line on WARN+
records. Function context is retained when file/line is unavailable; it is omitted
when it would repeat a complete source location. Source paths are portable (`src/...`, `qml/...` or a basename), without the
builder's home directory. Missing context stays missing. QML helper calls supply an
emitter tag; their C++ warning context identifies the helper, not an invented QML
line. Framework QML warnings retain the actual QML context when Qt supplies it.

A message without an explicit registered leading owner gets `[Runtime][Unattributed]`.
This is a capture fallback, not evidence of first-party conformance. Every multiline
continuation receives the same timestamp, severity, identity and warning context.
Only a session banner starting at the beginning of a physical line creates a session;
banner-like content inside a captured message cannot create a false restart.
Automatic FD inventories are not logged. MCP `debug_get_fds` remains available
for an explicit live descriptor/socket snapshot.

## Existing results and periodic samples

Prefer improving an existing result to adding a lifecycle around every action.
Visualizer retains its uploader/importer messages with consistent source tags;
covered payload dumps become IDs and numeric HTTP/network/parse details in those
messages. `core/logfields.h` bounds IDs to 128 characters and HTTP URL identity to
384, stripping credentials, query and fragment. It is shared with AI logging.
Successful diagnostic-file receipts add no result evidence and stay silent.

Battery polls retain every mode, requested-charge, discharge-cycle, OS-status and
power-source change, plus five percentage points from the last emitted reading.
Normal one-percent movement does not defeat suppression. Forecast results retain
first availability, changed provider/coverage, failure and recovery; routine
changing temperatures are available in the weather data. Repeated UI phase and
auto-load invocation receipts are omitted when the actual operation already logs
its outcome. Shot color and raw-weight traces are omitted; recorded shot samples,
stop/tare/settling decisions and real timer commands retain their separate value.
DNS discovery logs changed result counts/error state rather than every cycle
start/end; changing elapsed milliseconds does not defeat suppression.

Memory samples and exact peaks remain available on demand. Only sustained growth
is logged: three observed block medians (5, 30 or 120 samples per block), at least
5 MB overall, and at least a quarter of that growth in each interval. Zero/missing
readings or gaps over 90 seconds invalidate a window. A continuing trend uses
`LogCollapse` and five MB of further median growth; a quiet interval drops its
expired tally without a new summary. These thresholds are a diagnostic heuristic,
not proof of a leak. Routine snapshots, isolated jumps and QObject churn stay quiet.

## AI operation outcomes

Each AI request and bag extraction has an opaque `op` id, kind, stage, elapsed time,
known bag/shot id and provider/model captured at dispatch. Local fetch failures say
`provider=not-invoked`; page, archive and provider status codes distinguish the stage
that failed. Retries remain DEBUG and keep the operation id. Only the terminal
result is emitted automatically; start/dispatch/response/ready updates retain
context in memory. Failed and rejected outcomes are WARN.

A provider response is interpreted before the terminal verdict. `success` means usable
advice or parsed fields/URL, `empty` means a valid empty extraction/search result,
and `failed` includes invalid output. Busy/configuration guards are `rejected`.
`cancelled` means the owner was destroyed; `superseded` means the consumer stopped
waiting or did not continue the page-to-provider handoff. These diagnostic outcomes
do not cancel, retry, reroute or add requests. A late callback cannot add a second
terminal verdict. Page consumers hand off synchronously in the current application.

The main log contains bounded identifiers, URL scheme/host/path without credentials,
query or fragment, and numeric statuses. It omits prompts, page/response bodies and
remote error prose, including untrusted error codes. Existing separate AI prompt and
response files retain their purpose; a file-write receipt is not an operation verdict.

## Enforcement

`scripts/check_log_markers.py` scans first-party runtime C++, headers, QML/JS and
native bridges, including mixed-owner files and dormant platform code. It rejects
raw output calls, dynamic/unregistered helper owners, duplicate marker literals and
unregistered leading bracketed prefixes. Helper tokens and catalog rows are derived
from the registry. Strings and comments do not masquerade as raw calls.

An exception must have `// log-marker-exempt: <specific reason>` on the physical call
line. Use it only for a shared formatter, terminal sink, bootstrap fallback or
crash-safe writer. A neighboring comment cannot exempt another emitter. Tests,
command-line utilities outside runtime source roots, third-party code and generated
files are outside this source gate; their captured output may use Runtime.

The text-invariants workflow runs the checker and its `--self-test` negative fixtures
for changes to these source roots. It needs no Qt, compiler or network. Read the run
before merging: the check is not a required status check.

Historical logs are unchanged. Old registered filters still work; newly registered
owners cannot retroactively recover older unformatted messages. Start a review with
the complete unfiltered window and its prefix census, then use subsystem and severity
queries. A clean source gate or an empty WARN query does not prove a healthy runtime.

## Verify against a running app, not just the source

The last several defects in this area were invisible in review and obvious in one
session's log. Read the real thing:

```
debug_get_log  session=-1  minLevel="INFO"
```

Compare INFO+ startup volume against a recorded run of the same workflows. Counts depend on configured services and connected devices. What to
look for: an event appearing twice in different words; a bare marker with no source
tag; a `WARN` on something that is working; a device that reports a state change it
never made; and a subsystem that is **silent when it should not be** — the hardest to
notice, because nothing is there to catch your eye.
