namespace BasketAliases {

// The cross-sectional shape of the basket's brewing chamber. This is the
// single most useful "what kind of basket is it" axis for an AI advisor,
// because it changes how the puck behaves under flow:
//   Straight : vertical walls, holes carried right out to the edge. The
//              competition/precision geometry (VST, IMS, Weber Unibasket,
//              Pesado HE, Normcore). Full ~58mm active puck face, most even
//              water exit, the reference for flow profiling.
//   Tapered  : the wall narrows toward the bottom (classic stamped "stock"
//              basket). The effective puck face is smaller (~48mm) than the
//              rim. More forgiving but less even than straight walls.
//   Stepped  : the bore necks DOWN partway (Decent "waisted", S-Works /
//              Graph / Normcore step-down). Converts a 58mm group to a
//              smaller, deeper puck (~46–52mm) for more body and channel
//              tolerance at low doses; usually needs a bottomless portafilter.
//   Convex   : the floor bulges up in the centre (IMS Convex, S-Works /
//              Normcore convex), concentrating flow toward the middle and
//              demanding a slightly coarser grind.
// Note: every basket here is single-wall. Pressurized / dual-wall baskets are
// deliberately excluded — they self-regulate back-pressure and defeat the
// DE1's flow/pressure profiling, so they have no place on a Decent machine.
enum class WallProfile { Straight, Tapered, Stepped, Convex };

// How freely the basket passes water at a FIXED grind — the relative flow
// characteristic. This is the cross-basket knowledge an AI advisor wants: it
// can't be read off a single shot (flow on a fixed basket is constant), but it
// lets the advisor reason when a user SWITCHES baskets or wants to recreate a
// shot on different gear. e.g. a Weber Unibasket (Open) flows faster than a
// Decent stock double (Standard) at the same grind, so moving to it means
// grinding a touch finer to hold the same shot time.
//   Restrictive : finer filtration / lower open area, slower flow (IMS
//                 SuperFine 170µm, Normcore 0.18mm 'reduced flow', stock
//                 stamped baskets).
//   Standard    : a typical good precision basket (Decent, VST, IMS, most).
//                 The reference point.
//   Open        : holes carried to the edge / high open area / full-coverage
//                 patterns, noticeably faster (Weber Unibasket, Pesado HE,
//                 Wafo Spirit).
// This is intentionally COARSE — it gives the AI the DIRECTION of a grind
// change across baskets, not a magnitude. Reliable magnitude comes from the
// user's own per-basket shot history (equipment_id linkage + grind learning),
// not from a spec number.
// Compared for equality only (e.g. `flow != Standard` in summary());
// declaration order is NOT load-bearing — don't rely on Restrictive <
// Standard < Open as an ordered scale.
