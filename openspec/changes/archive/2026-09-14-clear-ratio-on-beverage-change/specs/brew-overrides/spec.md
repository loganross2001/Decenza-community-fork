## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Persistent Override Storage
The system SHALL store temperature and yield overrides in QSettings for persistence across app sessions. The yield override SHALL be stored as a `YieldSpec` — a value plus a `none` | `absolute` | `ratio` mode (`yield-anchor`) — not as a bare gram number.

"Active" is tracked by a genuine boolean flag (`hasTemperatureOverride`, `hasBrewYieldOverride`) that reflects whether a deliberate override is currently in effect — not merely whether an override value has ever been set during the session. For the yield, "active" SHALL be defined as `mode != none` and SHALL NEVER be inferred by comparing a resolved gram value against the profile's target weight — a ratio that happens to derive exactly the profile's target is still a deliberate, active anchor.

Overrides SHALL be cleared — the flag set false, not just the value resynced to a new default — when a recipe is activated (before its own overrides apply), or when the user taps "Clear" in the BrewDialog.

**On a profile switch the yield override SHALL be cleared when its mode is `absolute`, or when its mode is `ratio` and the new profile's beverage group differs from the previous profile's** (`yield-anchor`). A gram target describes the profile it was set against; a ratio fits one kind of drink, so it survives a switch within its group and re-derives against the current dose. A switch that leaves no yield override SHALL arm a saved yield as `yield-anchor` specifies; a maintenance profile clears nothing. The temperature override SHALL continue to clear on a profile switch, except that reloading the drink profile loaded before a maintenance run SHALL keep every override.

Loading a shot or favorite that carries its own frozen override value SHALL only mark the flag active when that frozen value genuinely differs from the freshly-loaded profile's own default (the same threshold the Shot Plan display uses), so a frozen value that happens to already match the current profile never falsely reports as an active override.

#### Scenario: Overrides persist between app sessions
- **WHEN** the user sets temperature or yield overrides in the BrewDialog
- **THEN** the values are immediately saved to QSettings
- **AND** when the app is restarted, the overrides are restored from QSettings — including the yield's mode
- **AND** the overrides remain active until explicitly cleared

#### Scenario: An absolute yield override clears on a profile switch
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{40.0, absolute}`, neither an active recipe nor the active bag saves a yield, and the user switches to a different profile
- **THEN** the yield override is cleared from QSettings and `hasBrewYieldOverride` becomes false
- **AND** the IdlePage shot plan returns to the new profile's target weight with no highlight

#### Scenario: A ratio yield override survives a profile switch
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{2.0, ratio}` and the user switches to a different espresso profile
- **THEN** the anchor remains `{2.0, ratio}` and `hasBrewYieldOverride` stays true
- **AND** the target re-derives against the current dose on the new profile

#### Scenario: A ratio yield override clears when the beverage group changes
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{2.5, ratio}`, neither an active recipe nor the active bag saves a yield, and the user switches from an espresso profile to a tea profile
- **THEN** `hasBrewYieldOverride` becomes false and the stop-at-weight target is the tea profile's own `target_weight`

#### Scenario: The bean's saved yield applies after a switch
- **WHEN** the active bag saves `{2.0, ratio}`, no recipe is active, and a profile switch leaves no yield override
- **THEN** the anchor is `{2.0, ratio}` and `hasBrewYieldOverride` is true

#### Scenario: Temperature still clears on a profile switch
- **WHEN** a temperature override is active and the user switches profiles
- **THEN** `hasTemperatureOverride` becomes false

#### Scenario: Returning from a cleaning run keeps the temperature override
- **WHEN** a temperature override is active on a profile, and the user loads a cleaning profile and then that profile again
- **THEN** the cleaning run brews at its own temperature, and the returning profile brews at the override

#### Scenario: Overrides cleared via BrewDialog
- **WHEN** the user taps "Clear" in the BrewDialog
- **THEN** all overrides are removed from QSettings and the override flags become false
- **AND** the Settings properties are reset to default values

#### Scenario: Overrides cleared on recipe activation
- **WHEN** a recipe is activated
- **THEN** the override flags reflect only that recipe's own stored overrides (or false, if it has none) — not a leftover flag from whatever was active before

#### Scenario: A ratio deriving the profile's own target still reads as active
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{2.0, ratio}`, the dose is 18 g, and the active profile's `target_weight` is 36 g
- **THEN** `hasBrewYieldOverride` is true and `brewByRatioActive` is true
- **AND** a subsequent dose change still re-derives the target

#### Scenario: Deactivation alone leaves the live setup untouched
- **WHEN** the active recipe is deactivated without switching profile or bag
- **THEN** the live brew values — including any override the recipe applied — remain in effect (deactivation drops the recipe association, not the dialed setup); the next profile or recipe switch clears them as above

#### Scenario: A frozen shot value matching the current profile is not flagged
- **WHEN** a shot or favorite is loaded whose saved `temperatureOverride` happens to equal the freshly-loaded profile's own default temperature
- **THEN** `hasTemperatureOverride` is false and the Shot Plan shows no highlight
