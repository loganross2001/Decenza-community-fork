// Non-visual candidate/step source for grind + RPM dial-in editing
// (replace-grind-inputs-with-picker). Extracted from GrindQuickSelectItem so
// every surface that edits a grind value — brew bar, Brew Settings, post-shot
// review, bag form, recipe wizard — generates candidates the same way.
//
// CONTEXT INJECTION: the grinder is a property of the VALUE being edited, not
// of the application. The host supplies the grinder that owns the value (the
// shot's grinder in post-shot review, the recipe's package in the wizard, the
// bag's equipment in the beans dialog, the active grinder on the brew bar) and
// every derived behaviour — notation, click-indexing, observed-history
// fallback, RPM capability — resolves against it.
// (The pre-split _observedFallback read Settings.dye.dyeGrinderModel — the
// active grinder — which was harmless while the brew bar was the only host and
// is exactly the bug this injection exists to prevent.)
//
// ONE carve-out, and step size is deliberately absent from the list above
// because of it: when NOTHING is injected, grindStep() and rpmStep() resolve
// the history they measure from against the ACTIVE grinder. That is a source
// of samples, not a semantic. An injected identity is never overridden, and
// notation, click-indexing and RPM capability never leave it. See grindStep().
//
// Per-candidate stepping is catalog-first via SettingsDye.stepGrinderSetting
// (numeric AND Compound "a+b" notation), then plain-numeric / number-in-text /
// letter fallbacks. When that lattice collapses, grindRowsFor's last-resort
// order is: for an EMPTY value, a median-anchored wide window (_medianObserved-
// Anchor -> _windowAround, #1605); otherwise the observed-history fallback.
// The negative-candidate semantics and the window width did change in this
// change: negatives now generate freely on plain-numeric grinders (a stepless
// collar's zero is a user-set calibration reference), while click-indexed
// (Compound) grinders skip them in both the catalog path and the JS fallback.
