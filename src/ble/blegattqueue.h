/**
 * The one GATT operation queue, shared by every BLE peripheral in the process.
 *
 * ---- Why this exists ----------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Qt serializes GATT work PER CONTROLLER: `readWriteQueue` and `pendingJob` are
 * instance fields of QtBluetoothLE, one instance per QLowEnergyController
 * (qtconnectivity/src/android/bluetooth/.../QtBluetoothLE.java:949-950), and the
 * darwin backend has no cross-peripheral queue either. Nothing in the framework
 * orders one peripheral's operations against another's, on any platform.
 *
 * That is issue #1819. A scale's connect and characteristic discovery ran across
 * the DE1's notification-enable descriptor writes; all three were rejected with
 * DescriptorWriteError, and the app went on to report the machine CONNECTED with
 * STATE_INFO, SHOT_SAMPLE and WATER_LEVELS never enabled — no chart, no shot
 * detection, no stop-at-weight, and a shot that ran until stopped by hand.
 *
 * de1app has one queue for the DE1 and the scale together — `::de1(cmdstack)`
 * with a single `::de1(wrote)` in-flight flag (`machine.tcl:132-133`,
 * `de1_comms.tcl:43,56-59`) — so the state is unreachable there rather than
 * handled better. That is the precedent this follows.
 *
 * decaid is NOT a second precedent, and an earlier version of this comment said
 * it was. It sets `UniversalBle.queueType = QueueType.perDevice`
 * (`universal_ble_discovery_service.dart:403`) and its own comment says why:
 * "each BLE peripheral gets its own command queue, so DE1 GATT operations never
 * block scale heartbeat writes and vice versa". That is a deliberate choice to
 * allow the concurrency #1819 is about — a considered counter-example, recorded
 * here rather than quietly dropped, because a reader weighing this design should
 * know a peer app went the other way on purpose.
 *
 * ---- What is deliberately NOT here --------------------------------------
 *
 * **No timer that decides an operation has finished.** Dispatch is driven by the
 * operation's terminal outcome — noteSucceeded() or noteFailed() — and by
 * teardown. Where a platform can deliver neither (Android's
 * handleOnDescriptorWrite discards a reply arriving after Qt's own 3 s
 * RUNNABLE_TIMEOUT and notifies nothing), the release comes from the requesting
 * transport's EXISTING terminal machinery, which already bounds that operation
 * and verifies real state before acting. A second bound here would recreate the
 * exact condition this change removes: BleTransport's SUBSCRIBE_TIMEOUT_MS was
 * 3000 against Qt's own 3000, and it turned a DescriptorWriteError that arrived
 * at +45 ms into a 3 s stall, three times in one connect.
 *
 * **The queue owns no QTimer at all.** Dispatch is posted with a queued
 * invocation rather than a zero-interval timer, which is the same thing said
 * honestly: it is an event-loop hop, not a duration. The only delay left in the
 * class is an operation's own retry backoff, which is a property of that
 * operation and travels with it.
 *
 * ---- Policy travels with the operation ----------------------------------
 *
 * Retry budget and retry delay are per Operation, not per queue. The DE1's
 * tuned values (MAX_WRITE_RETRIES=5 and the corpus derivation behind it, and
 * WRITE_RETRY_DELAY_MS) stay attached to DE1 operations, and everything else
 * defaults to zero retries — which is exactly what the scale and refractometer
 * transports did before they had a queue at all.
 *
 * The DE1's old 50 ms inter-write pacing is NOT carried across. It was armed
 * only on an enqueue that found the link idle, and the completion path
 * dispatched the next command with no delay at all, so it paced the first write
 * after a pause and never consecutive ones. Reproducing it as a real per-write
 * interval would have added ~1 s to a 20-write profile upload for the first
 * time. What kept the link from being flooded is the property below, not that
 * constant.
 *
 * Defaulting scales to the DE1's budget would be actively harmful, not merely
 * generous: a dead scale link would hold the shared slot through the DE1's
 * ~32 s worst-case retry sequence, starving the machine the budget exists to
 * protect.

/**
 * The outer bound for service and characteristic DISCOVERY, as opposed to a
 * read or a write.
 *
 * Shared by every transport rather than declared per class: it answers one
 * question, and the answer is a property of the radio, not of who is asking.
 * Characteristic discovery took 6.0 s in the #1819 capture (23.13 s to 29.14 s),
 * so a write-sized budget would not be a bound on it — it would be a guarantee
 * of failure.
 *
 * Like every clock in this subsystem it decides only "no answer at all is also
 * an answer". It is not a second opinion about an operation the platform does
 * answer; those end on their own terminal signals.
