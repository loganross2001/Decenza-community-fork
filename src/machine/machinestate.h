    // Registered to QML by MachineStateForeign (core/contextsingletons_qml.h), replacing BOTH
    // the setContextProperty("MachineState", …) and the
    // qmlRegisterUncreatableType<MachineState>(…, "MachineStateType") that main.cpp used to do. The two existed because a context property shadows a type of the same name, so the
    // enums had to be reached under a second, invented name. A QML_SINGLETON needs no such
    // split: `MachineState.Phase.Pouring` resolves through the singleton, and unlike either of
    // the runtime calls it is visible to qmllint, qmlcachegen and the language server. Full
    // rationale in src/controllers/maincontroller.h.
    //
    // ONE REAL BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE, and it is not obvious from the macros. Qt resolves enums on a
    // singleton INSIDE the instance guard — qqmltypewrapper.cpp:320,
    // `if (QObject *qobjectSingleton = enginePrivate->singletonInstance<QObject*>(type))`, with
    // the enum branch within it. The old uncreatable-type registration took the `else` at :361,
    // which needs no instance at all. So the 157 `MachineState.Phase.X` reads in qml/ (on 155
    // lines) used to be instance-independent constants and now depend on the publish below.
    //
    // Miss that publish and `MachineState.Phase` is `undefined`, so reading `.Pouring` off it
    // THROWS a TypeError with a file and line — these sites are the loud ones. The quiet damage
    // is elsewhere in the same failure: `Connections { target: MachineState }` (20+ sites)
    // resolves its target to null and simply never connects, and plain reads like
    // `MachineState.isReady` are `undefined`, hence falsy, so guarded actions refuse while
    // logging only their own "cannot start" line. If you are ever debugging that, look at the
    // Connections, not at the enums. tst_qmlregistration asserts the publish call for exactly
    // this reason.
    //
    // The enum survives the move to a foreign wrapper: QML_FOREIGN registers THIS class's
    // metaobject, so Q_ENUM(Phase) is exported exactly as before — verified against the
    // generated Decenza.qmltypes, which carries the same `Enum { name: "Phase" }` block with
    // all its values either way.
