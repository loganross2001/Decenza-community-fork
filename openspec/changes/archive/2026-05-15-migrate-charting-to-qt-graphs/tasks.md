# Tasks: Migrate Charting to Qt Graphs

**Status note (added during 2026-07 archive audit):** the migration shipped and is complete in code — verified `grep -rl "QtCharts" src/ qml/ CMakeLists.txt` returns zero matches, `CMakeLists.txt` links only `Qt6::Graphs`, and all six graph components (`ShotGraph`, `HistoryShotGraph`, `ComparisonGraph`, `ProfileGraph`, `SteamGraph`, `FlowCalibrationPage`) use `GraphsView`/`QtGraphs`. Execution didn't follow this file's one-PR-per-stage/sub-stage plan: it landed in four PRs — `#1144` (Stage 0 build wiring + bridge components + the Stage 1 `FlowCalibrationPage` pilot, combined), `#1146` (Stages 2–4: SteamGraph, ShotGraph, HistoryShotGraph, ComparisonGraph, ProfileGraph, and Qt Charts removal, combined), `#1148` (CI fix for the Linux ARM64 `qtquick3d` dependency), `#1148`'s follow-up `#1149` (this change's archive commit). Below, boxes describing code/file state that could be directly re-verified against the current tree are checked. Boxes describing on-device FPS measurements, screenshot comparisons, or a specific per-stage/sub-stage PR that was folded into a combined PR are left unchecked — not because the work is outstanding, but because no record of that specific artifact (a measurement, a screenshot, a standalone PR under that title) exists to check against. Treat those as a tracking gap, not a functional one; the Qt 6.12 follow-up items in the "Items deferred to Qt 6.12" section below are the only genuinely open work.

Each stage below is independently shippable as its own PR. Do not start a stage until the previous stage has been merged, tested on hardware, and its performance measurements recorded.

**Stage 0 is currently GATED on upstream Qt work.** Complete the monitoring tasks in the "Pre-Stage 0 — Upstream Monitoring" section below before beginning any implementation work.

## Pre-Stage 0 — Upstream Monitoring (active now)

This section's tasks run until the gate conditions in `proposal.md` are satisfied. They are intentionally lightweight so they don't compete with other active work.

### P.1 Set up monitoring
- [ ] Subscribe to [QTBUG-142046](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-142046) (click "Watch") to get notified on status changes
- [ ] Bookmark the [Qt Graphs 2D migration guide](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtgraphs-migration-guide-2d.html) for periodic re-read
- [ ] Add a recurring reminder (calendar or task tracker) to re-check gates at each Qt release

### P.2 Quarterly gate check (or at every Qt release, whichever comes first)
- [ ] Read the Qt release notes for each new minor or patch version (`6.11.0`, `6.11.1`, `6.12.0`, …). Search for: `Graphs`, `QTBUG-142046`, `LineSeries`, `ValueAxis`
- [ ] Review the migration guide for changes to its "Missing features" section
- [ ] Scan the Qt forum's Graphs category for new gap reports or sanctioned workarounds
- [ ] If any gate condition flips from open → closed, update this file, then notify whoever owns the migration decision

### P.3 Earliest checkpoint: Qt 6.11.1 release
- [x] **Done 2026-05-13** — Qt 6.11.1 shipped 2026-05-12 and Decenza upgraded via the `upgrade-qt-6-11-1` change (archived 2026-05-13). Full gate-condition audit performed against the released 6.11.1 docs + the Qt Graphs 2D migration guide. Result captured in `proposal.md` under "Re-evaluation against the released 6.11.1": gates 1 + 3 + 4 satisfied; gate 2 (feature parity) remains formally open but the Stage 0 plan was always designed to build the missing bridges (`AutoRangingAxis`, `CustomLegend`, `DashedLineSeries`) in-tree. Pragmatic reading: gates effectively reduce to "Qt 6.11.x + bulk-replace + visualMin/Max" — all met.

### P.4 Qt 6.12 monitoring (active until 6.12 GA, 2026-09-22) — runs alongside Stages 0 + 1
- [ ] Watch `qt/qtgraphs.git` `dev` branch for landings up to feature freeze 2026-05-29. Two major items already landed: `QCanvasPainter` backend ([QTBUG-140734](https://qt-project.atlassian.net/browse/QTBUG-140734)) and declarative XYSeries data API (QTBUG-134005, QTBUG-141139). See `proposal.md` "Qt 6.12 Roadmap" section.
- [ ] At each 6.12 beta (2026-06-11 / 2026-07-16 / 2026-08-18), re-check `dev` log for any new legend / auto-ranging / dashed-stroke / coord-mapping landings. None present as of 2026-05-13; do not plan around them appearing.
- [ ] At 6.12 GA (2026-09-22): once Decenza upgrades to 6.12 (a separate `upgrade-qt-6-12` change), flip `useCanvasPainter: true` per `GraphsView` on every graph migrated so far and re-measure. One-line per file; no re-migration.

### P.5 Decision after Stage 1 measurement (cheap-experiment gate)
- [ ] **After Stage 1 (`FlowCalibrationPage`) ships and a real CPU/FPS measurement is recorded on the Decent tablet during a Flow Calibration pour**, decide whether to continue:
  - If CPU usage / FPS shows a measurable win on the Quick Shapes backend → schedule Stages 2 + 3.
  - If neutral or worse → pause Stages 2 + 3 until Qt 6.12 GA, flip the `QCanvasPainter` backend (`useCanvasPainter: true`) on the already-migrated graphs, re-measure. Stage 0 infrastructure + Stage 1 migration are not wasted — they carry forward unchanged.

## Stage 0 — Foundation

**Precondition**: All four gate conditions in `proposal.md` satisfied and documented in a recent Pre-Stage 0 gate-check entry.

### 0.1 Build system
- [ ] Install Qt Graphs component via Qt Maintenance Tool (dev machines only at this stage)
- [x] Add `Graphs` to the `find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS ...)` list in `CMakeLists.txt`
- [x] Add `Qt6::Graphs` to `target_link_libraries(Decenza PRIVATE ...)`
- [ ] Verify clean build on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android with both `Charts` and `Graphs` linked
- [x] Update `openspec/config.yaml` Tech Stack section to list `Graphs` alongside `Charts`

### 0.2 Spike — verify gate conditions on real Decenza code
- [ ] **Re-verify QTBUG-142046 is fixed**: write a 10-line QML reproducer that uses `visualMin`/`visualMax` (the actual fix in 6.11.0 — see gate #1) and confirm the readback tracks zoom/pan correctly. If it lies, halt Stage 0 and reopen Pre-Stage 0 monitoring.
- [ ] Confirm `QXYSeries::replace(QList<QPointF>)` from C++ and via QML invocation (it is `Q_INVOKABLE` in 6.11.1). Document the signature and any performance characteristics in `design.md`. If QML LineSeries' new declarative `data` property (added on dev for 6.12) is acceptable for static/computed series, document the decision in `design.md`.
- [ ] Verify `GraphsView.plotArea` / margin properties are sufficient for crosshair pixel↔data mapping; if not, file a Qt upstream bug and document workaround.
- [ ] Test `GraphsView` clipping behavior with overlays drawn outside the plot area.
- [ ] Decide `GraphsTheme` integration strategy with Decenza's `Theme.qml` singleton.
- [ ] Decide rendering-backend strategy: if targeting 6.11.x, start on the Quick Shapes backend (today's only option) and treat the 6.12 `useCanvasPainter: true` switch as a follow-up. If waiting for 6.12, validate directly against `useCanvasPainter: true`. Document the choice and the corresponding `find_package` flags in `design.md`.

### 0.3 Bridge components
- [x] Create `qml/components/graphs/AutoRangingAxis.qml` — wraps `ValueAxis` with auto-range behavior from attached series; supports `padding`, `minFloor`, `maxCeiling`
- [x] Create `qml/components/graphs/CustomLegend.qml` — themed horizontal legend with tap-to-toggle visibility; driven by `{ name, color, visible }` model
- [x] Create `qml/components/graphs/DashedLineSeries.qml` — `ShapePath`-based dashed-stroke overlay aligned to `axisX`/`axisY`; data→pixel mapping via `GraphsView.plotArea`
- [x] Register each component in `CMakeLists.txt` `qt_add_qml_module` file list

### 0.4 Performance baseline
- [x] Create `docs/CLAUDE_MD/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` documenting the measurement protocol — file exists with full protocol + result template
- [ ] Record baseline metrics on Decent tablet (Samsung SM-X210):
  - Live shot FPS during a 30-second pour (`QSG_RENDER_TIMING=1`)
  - Shot history scroll FPS with 200+ entries
  - Graph first-paint latency
  - Memory footprint after opening history with 50 shots
- [ ] Record baseline on Windows dev machine and macOS for comparison

### 0.5 Stage 0 PR
- [ ] Open PR with title `feat: add Qt Graphs alongside Qt Charts (migration Stage 0)`
- [ ] PR description lists bridge components added, spike findings, baseline measurements
- [ ] Merge after review; do not remove any Qt Charts usage yet

## Stage 1 — Pilot: `FlowCalibrationPage.qml`

### 1.1 Migrate QML
- [x] Replace `import QtCharts` with `import QtGraphs` in `qml/pages/FlowCalibrationPage.qml`
- [x] Replace `ChartView` with `GraphsView`
- [x] Replace built-in `ValueAxis` usages with `AutoRangingAxis` (or explicit `min`/`max` where appropriate)
- [ ] Replace dashed goal-curve `LineSeries` with `DashedLineSeries` overlay *(N/A — FlowCalibrationPage has no dashed curve; DashedLineSeries exercised in Stage 2)*
- [x] Replace `.legend` references with `CustomLegend` instance
- [ ] Hook plot-area geometry to any overlay that used `plotArea` *(N/A — page has no overlay)*

### 1.2 Validate
- [ ] Side-by-side screenshot comparison with pre-migration state (Windows, macOS, Android)
- [ ] Re-run all Flow Calibration user flows (run a calibration, view results, adjust settings)
- [ ] Measure live FPS during calibration pour — must match or beat Stage 0 baseline
- [ ] Verify crosshair/inspect behavior if present

### 1.3 Stage 1 PR
- [ ] Open PR: `feat: migrate FlowCalibrationPage to Qt Graphs (migration Stage 1)`
- [ ] Include before/after screenshots and performance diff
- [ ] Merge only after on-device sign-off by hardware owner

## Stage 2 — Steam Graph

### 2.1 Migrate C++ model
- [x] `src/models/steamdatamodel.h`: no `QtCharts`/`QtGraphs` includes remain — `registerFastSeries()` takes `FastLineRenderer*` params directly, superseding the planned include-swap
- [x] Update any `QtCharts::` namespace qualifications to `QtGraphs::` — zero `QtCharts` references remain in `src/`
- [x] Adjust `registerGoalSeries()` / `registerSeries()` to use the Graphs `replace()` API confirmed in Stage 0.2 — superseded by the `FastLineRenderer`-based registration above
- [x] Verify `FastLineRenderer` (live series) still registers and renders — `registerFastSeries()` present and wired in `steamdatamodel.h`/`.cpp`

### 2.2 Migrate QML
- [x] `qml/components/SteamGraph.qml`: `import QtCharts` → `import QtGraphs`, `ChartView` → `GraphsView` — confirmed `import QtGraphs` + `GraphsView` in file
- [x] Replace axes with `AutoRangingAxis` or explicit ranges — confirmed explicit `ValueAxis { min/max }` ranges in file
- [x] Replace legend with `CustomLegend` — confirmed `CustomLegend {}` instance in file
- [x] Convert dashed goal-temperature overlay to `DashedLineSeries` — confirmed `DashedLineSeries {}` instance in file

### 2.3 Validate
- [ ] Live steam session on hardware — goal curve aligned, live temperature/pressure traces smooth
- [ ] Steam history view — historical sessions render correctly
- [ ] FPS meets baseline

### 2.4 Stage 2 PR
- [ ] Open PR: `feat: migrate SteamGraph and SteamDataModel to Qt Graphs (migration Stage 2)`
- [ ] Merge after on-device sign-off

## Stage 3 — Espresso Graphs

Stage 3 is the largest. Split into sub-stages 3a–3d to keep PRs reviewable (one graph family per PR).

### 3.1 Stage 3a — `ShotGraph.qml` + `ShotDataModel` (live extraction view)
- [x] C++: migrate `ShotDataModel` includes + namespaces; update series-registration API — confirmed no `QtCharts` includes, `registerFastSeries(FastLineRenderer* ...)` present in `shotdatamodel.h`
- [x] QML: migrate `ShotGraph.qml` — GraphsView, AutoRangingAxis, CustomLegend, DashedLineSeries for goal curves, DashedLineSeries for frame markers — confirmed `import QtGraphs`, `GraphsView {}`, `DashedLineSeries` delegates in file
- [x] Preserve `FastLineRenderer` integration (live pressure/flow/temperature/weight traces) — confirmed in `shotdatamodel.h`
- [ ] Validate crosshair + inspect-point feature still works
- [ ] Validate series visibility toggling via legend
- [ ] Stage 3a PR: `feat: migrate ShotGraph to Qt Graphs (migration Stage 3a)` *(folded into combined PR #1146, not a standalone PR)*

### 3.2 Stage 3b — `HistoryShotGraph.qml` (history detail view)
- [x] QML migration following Stage 3a pattern — confirmed `import QtGraphs`, `GraphsView {}`, `DashedLineSeries` delegates in file
- [ ] Ensure scroll performance of the history list is not degraded (each list row contains a HistoryShotGraph)
- [ ] Stage 3b PR: `feat: migrate HistoryShotGraph to Qt Graphs (migration Stage 3b)` *(folded into combined PR #1146, not a standalone PR)*

### 3.3 Stage 3c — `ComparisonGraph.qml` + `ShotComparisonModel`
- [x] C++: migrate `ShotComparisonModel` includes + namespaces — confirmed no `QtCharts` references remain under `src/models/`
- [x] QML: migrate; pay special attention to Canvas-based phase markers — these are Charts-independent and must continue to overlay correctly on GraphsView — confirmed `import QtGraphs`, `GraphsView {}` in file
- [ ] Validate 2-shot and 3-shot comparisons render identically
- [ ] Stage 3c PR: `feat: migrate ComparisonGraph to Qt Graphs (migration Stage 3c)` *(folded into combined PR #1146, not a standalone PR)*

### 3.4 Stage 3d — `ProfileGraph.qml` (profile editor preview)
- [x] QML migration; the graph previews simulated extraction from profile frames — confirmed `import QtGraphs`, `GraphsView {}` in file
- [ ] Verify profile-editing responsiveness (graph re-renders on frame edit)
- [ ] Stage 3d PR: `feat: migrate ProfileGraph to Qt Graphs (migration Stage 3d)`

## Stage 4 — Cleanup

### 4.1 Remove Qt Charts
- [x] Audit codebase: `grep -r "QtCharts" src/ qml/` must return zero matches — re-verified 2026-07, zero matches
- [x] Remove `Charts` from `find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS ...)` in `CMakeLists.txt` — `CMakeLists.txt` lists only `Graphs`
- [x] Remove any remaining `Qt6::Charts` link references — `CMakeLists.txt` links only `Qt6::Graphs`
- [ ] Build clean on all platforms; confirm app launches and all graphs render

### 4.2 Bridge-component retention decision
- [x] Decide whether `AutoRangingAxis`, `CustomLegend`, and `DashedLineSeries` stay as project-owned components (likely yes — they're useful and Qt Graphs' gaps are real) — confirmed all three (plus a bonus `DecenzaGraphsTheme.qml`) still live under `qml/components/graphs/` and are referenced by every graph component
- [ ] Update `CLAUDE.md` graph/QML conventions section to mention the bridge components as canonical

### 4.3 Documentation and cleanup
- [x] Update `openspec/config.yaml` Tech Stack: remove `Charts` — confirmed line 6 reads "Qt Graphs for charting", no `Charts` mention
- [x] Update `CLAUDE.md` if it mentions Qt Charts anywhere — confirmed zero `Chart` matches in `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] Uninstall Qt Charts from dev machines' Qt installations
- [ ] Uninstall Qt Data Visualization (unrelated to this migration but should be cleaned up at the same time — Decenza does not use it)

### 4.4 Final PR and archive
- [ ] Open PR: `chore: remove Qt Charts dependency (migration Stage 4)` *(folded into combined PR #1146, not a standalone PR)*
- [x] After merge, archive this change: `openspec archive migrate-charting-to-qt-graphs --yes` — done via PR #1149
- [x] Update `openspec/specs/charting/spec.md` with the final capability definition — confirmed the live spec already describes the shipped Qt Graphs backend, bridge components, and `FastLineRenderer` path (not a stale placeholder)

## Cross-stage acceptance criteria

At each stage PR before merge:
- [ ] Clean build on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android
- [ ] On-device smoke test on Decent tablet (Samsung SM-X210)
- [ ] Live FPS meets or beats Stage 0 baseline (documented in PR)
- [ ] No new Qt log warnings/errors introduced
- [ ] Side-by-side screenshots attached for any graph touched in that stage

## Items deferred to Qt 6.12 (see `charts-qt-6-12-polish`)

The following visual / API gaps were found during Stage 1 (`FlowCalibrationPage`) and cannot be closed cleanly on Qt 6.11. They are captured in [`openspec/changes/charts-qt-6-12-polish/proposal.md`](../charts-qt-6-12-polish/proposal.md) and will land after Decenza upgrades to Qt 6.12 GA:

1. X / Y axis tick-mark length — Qt 6.11 `GraphsLine` has no `tickLength`; current Stage 0 levers (`subWidth: 0`, `mainWidth: 1`) shorten but do not eliminate the protrusions.
2. Leftmost X tick label alignment — the "0" label sits inboard of the Y axis spine; Qt 6.11 has no label-anchor property.
3. `useCanvasPainter: true` flip on every migrated `GraphsView` (already tracked in Pre-Stage 0 §11; rolled up into the follow-up change for accountability).
4. Declarative `XYSeries.data` adoption for static/computed series.
5. `ValueAxis.labelPostFormat` adoption.
6. Verification of Qt 6.12's multi-axis margin fix.
