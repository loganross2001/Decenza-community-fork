# SAW (Stop-At-Weight) Learning

## Problem

The DE1's stop-at-weight feature has to send the stop command *before* the target weight is reached, because there is unavoidable lag between the command and pump shutdown:

```
total drip ≈ flow_at_stop × (BLE_round_trip_lag + DE1_machine_lag) + post_shutoff_drip
```

The two hardware lags are scale-specific (`Settings::sensorLag()` documents them; e.g., Decent Scale 0.38 s, Acaia 0.69 s, Bookoo 0.50 s) and the post-shutoff drip is profile- and portafilter-specific. Together they yield a total "drip after stop trigger" the controller has to predict in advance, then trigger the stop when `current_weight + predicted_drip ≥ target`.

For years the predictor learned a single drip-vs-flow curve per scale type, stored as a rolling history of `{drip, flow, scale, overshoot}` records in QSettings (`saw/learningHistory`). That model worked for users on a single profile but gradually accumulated systematic error for users who alternate between profiles with different drip dynamics.

[Issue #847](https://github.com/Kulitorum/Decenza/issues/847) reported the failure mode in unambiguous terms: a user alternating between an open-spout portafilter with one profile and a double-spout portafilter with another saw the model overshoot for the dominant pairing and undershoot for the secondary pairing. The learning was being pulled by whichever profile-portafilter combo the user pulled most often, contaminating the prediction for the rarer one.

## Empirical evidence (this device, Apr 2026)

Pulling SAW debug logs from real shots on a Decent Scale showed the contamination directly:

| Shot | Profile | Trigger flow | expectedDrip | Settled drip | Result |
|------|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| 1056 | 80's Espresso | 1.99 g/s | 1.04 g | ~0.9 g | close |
| 1059 | 80's Espresso | 2.04 g/s | 1.13 g | 1.1 g | accurate |
| 1054 | 80's Espresso (short shot, fast end-flow) | 5.20 g/s | 1.27 g | ~2.5 g | **2× under-predicted** |
| 1047 | **D-Flow / Q** | 2.30 g/s | 1.24 g | ~0.8 g | **0.4 g over-predicted** |

Shot 1047 is the smoking gun. D-Flow / Q's actual drip is consistently ~0.8 g but the global model predicted 1.24 g — a systematic 0.4 g undershoot per shot, exactly the issue #847 pattern. The model was being pulled toward 80's Espresso's drip dynamics because that is the user's more frequent profile. D-Flow's lower drip rate never got a chance to teach the model its own signature.

Shot 1054 is a separate point: even within a single profile, end-of-shot flow can vary 2.5×. The drip-vs-flow regression already in place handles that, so we kept it.

## Solution: per-(profile, scale) batched learning

The same architecture that fixed the analogous problem in flow calibration ([AUTO_FLOW_CALIBRATION.md](AUTO_FLOW_CALIBRATION.md), issue [#739](https://github.com/Kulitorum/Decenza/issues/739)) applies cleanly to SAW:

1. **Per-(profile, scale) history** — each pair learns its own drip dynamics. Switching profiles or scales does not contaminate the active pair's data.
2. **Batched median commits** — accumulate 3 shots' worth of pending entries before changing the model. The median is robust to single-shot outliers (channeling, scale glitches, cup interaction). N=3 is chosen because SAW has no feedback loop (a stop command does not alter pump dynamics for the next shot), so a single confirmed 3-shot batch is sufficient signal — the conservative N=5 from flow calibration is not needed here.
3. **Batch-level dispersion check** — if the 3 lags within a batch are too spread out (any single lag > 1.5 s from the batch median), the whole batch is dropped. Dispersion that high indicates the user changed conditions mid-batch (different beans, different grinder, manual stop). IQR gating requires ≥ 4 values; with N=3 the per-element deviation check handles all outlier cases.
4. **Global bootstrap** — the median lag across the graduated `(profile, scale, basket)` buckets on the same scale is published as `saw/globalBootstrapLag/<scaleType>`. New pairs use this as their first-shot default instead of the scale's hardware-only `sensorLag()`.
5. **Read-path fallback chain** — `perProfile` (≥ `kSawMinMediansForGraduation` committed batches, currently 1 = 3 SAW shots minimum) → `globalBootstrap` → `globalPool` (legacy entries) → `scaleDefault`. New users / new pairs degrade gracefully.

### Why this is the right shape

The two systems (flow cal and SAW) are learning the same kind of correction: a per-shot scalar that depends on (profile dynamics × hardware quirks), where the hardware quirk has a known prior (sensor lag for SAW, density correction for flow cal) and the profile contribution is what we have to learn from data. Both benefit from:

- **Isolation by profile** — to eliminate cross-profile bias.
- **Median over mean** — to absorb single-shot anomalies without explicit outlier detection.
- **Batched updates** — to break the feedback loop where each model change alters the conditions for the next shot.
- **Global fallback** — to cold-start new profiles from the system's collective experience instead of from a constant.

Reusing flow cal's design for SAW reduces risk because the patterns are already in production and have a year of operational evidence behind them.

## Storage schema

Three QSettings keys, each a JSON object keyed by `"<profileFilename>::<scaleType>::<basketKey>"`:

| Key | Shape | Trim | Purpose |
|-----|-------|------|---------|
| `saw/perProfileHistory` | array of committed batch-median entries `{drip, flow, overshoot, scale, profile, basket, ts, batchSize}` | 10 medians (~30 shots-worth) | Source of truth for `sawLearnedLagFor` / `getExpectedDripFor` once the triple has graduated (≥ `kSawMinMediansForGraduation` medians, currently 1). |
| `saw/perProfileBatch` | array of pending raw entries `{drip, flow, overshoot, scale, profile, basket, ts}` (target size 3) | 3 (commit point) | Pending accumulator; flushed on commit or rejection. |
| `saw/globalBootstrapLag/<scaleType>` | scalar `double` (seconds) | n/a | IQR-fenced median of the last committed median lag from each THREE-SEGMENT bucket on this scale whose newest median is not `inherited` (so neither the seed copies nor the frozen pre-basket bucket they came from can vote). Used as first-shot default for new pairs. (Graduation for the per-profile *read* path is a stricter `kSawMinMediansForGraduation` medians; the bootstrap is a cold-start prior, so it accepts pairs with any committed history — IQR fencing handles the rest.) |

The legacy `saw/learningHistory` key is preserved as a **global pool**: every committed batch-median is mirrored into it (trim 50). This keeps `isSawConverged()` and the legacy convergence-divergence detection working without changes, and provides a final read-path fallback for users with pre-update data.

The per-entry shape gains one optional field, `profile`. Old entries without it are still readable.

### The basket segment, and why there is no migration

`basketKey` is the active equipment package's basket brand + model, lowercased with every run of non-alphanumerics collapsed to `-` (`Graph Coffee` + `Stepped 58→46mm` → `graph-coffee-stepped-58-46mm`). A package with no basket keys on the literal `(none)`, which a real basket cannot produce because `(` and `)` are not alphanumeric and so never reach the output (the output is NOT restricted to `[a-z0-9-]`: any Unicode letter or digit passes). `SettingsCalibration::sawBasketKey()` is the only producer.

**The upgrade copies, it does not fall back and it does not pick a winner.** `seedSawBucketsFromPreBasketKeys()` copies each pre-basket two-segment bucket into `"<profile>::<scale>::<basket>"` for **every basket that profile was actually pulled with**, once, guarded by `saw/basketKeyMigrated`. Each such combination then predicts exactly what the single shared model predicted before the upgrade, and diverges as it earns medians of its own. Properties worth knowing:

- **Scoped per profile, not the product.** A basket used with one profile says nothing about another, so seeding every (profile × basket) combination would fabricate buckets for combinations the user never tried. A profile with no shots in the window is left alone entirely — untried means untried.
- **Copy, not move.** The two-segment keys stay in place — inert, unread, but readable by an older build on rollback, which also makes the seed repeatable rather than one-shot.
- **Copies are tagged `inherited`,** and `recomputeGlobalSawBootstrap()` skips buckets whose newest median carries that tag. Without it, one batch of shots copied into N baskets would vote N times in the cross-basket median and drag the prior onto itself.
- **Additive and idempotent.** A basket that already has data is never overwritten, and the flag is set only on a run the caller marks complete, so an early partial run cannot foreclose the rest.
- **Pending batches are copied but never committed** — the commit path owns the dispersion gate and the auto-reset check.
- `resetSawLearning()` clears the flag with the buckets, so a store restored from a pre-basket backup seeds again instead of coming back unreadable.
- **"Created nothing" is two different states and the seed must tell them apart.** No bucket's profile matching the window is a key-derivation failure: it warns and leaves the flag open. Every target ALREADY existing is a store that was seeded before and had its flag reopened — it closes the flag quietly. Conflating them cost nothing at first glance and was a real defect: `sawLearningImport()` reopens the flag, and a donor device is normally already seeded, so every launch after a device transfer warned "key-derivation failure" and never closed. Found by clearing the flag on a live seeded store, not by reading the code.

**The combinations come from the SHOT HISTORY, not the equipment inventory** — `ShotHistoryStorage::requestRecentProfileBasketPairs(500)`, a bounded query joining `shots.equipment_id` to `equipment_items` where `kind='basket'` and returning distinct (profile title, basket) pairs, wired in `MainController` where the storages already are. A user can own 25 baskets and pull shots with three; seeding from the inventory would fabricate 22 buckets of borrowed data.

Two mechanical notes on that query. It is windowed rather than a `DISTINCT` over the whole table because `shots` carries the `debug_log` and `profile_json` blobs, so a full scan drags those pages along — the cost note on `queryDistinctList` applies. And `shots.profile_name` is the profile **TITLE** while SAW keys use the **FILENAME**, so `MainController` maps each one through `ProfileManager::titleToFilename()`; `titleToFilename` is a pure slug transform that consults no catalog, so a deleted profile still yields a filename; what drops out is a title whose slug matches no stored key, i.e. a RENAMED profile, whose bucket is then counted as left behind. The wiring cannot live in `Settings`: that class has no handle on the shot database.

**Two designs were built and rejected before this one, both worth knowing about because each reads as the safer choice.** First, a permanent basket-blind fallback tier: nothing ever writes those buckets, so they never trim and never age out — the claim that they would was simply false — and keeping them alive meant a second reader, a blended "warmup" tier, and two extra `sawModelSource` values with their UI and advisor branches, forever, to smooth about six shots per user once. Second, re-keying onto the single ACTIVE basket: on the maintainer's own device that would have labelled 1038 shots of Decent-basket history as the 4-shot Graph basket (both are the packages' own `shotCount` aggregates), because the rarely-used package happened to be active. Copying into each combination the shot history actually shows avoids having to judge which basket owns the history at all.

### Why the basket is in the key (and the grinder is not)

Measured on this device, D-Flow / Q on a Decent Scale, same bean and dose: the Decent 18g Ridged basket drips 1.00–1.48 g (mean 1.32) while the Graph Stepped 58→46mm drips 0.52–0.70 g (mean 0.63). Every Graph shot under-delivered by ~0.7 g because the model predicted the Decent basket's drip. Flow-similarity weighting cannot absorb it — the offset is basket-shaped, not flow-shaped — and shot 1085 (Decent basket, 53.3 s, flow 1.58 g/s, drip 1.34 g) rules out shot duration as the cause against Graph shot 1098 (52.1 s, flow 1.48 g/s, drip 0.66 g).

Grinder, burrs, RPM and puck prep stay OUT of the key: they act on drip through puck permeability, which already reaches the model as flow at stop. Portafilter/spout is not modelled at all — the responsible geometry is basket plus spout, but nearly all users run bottomless. Full evidence and the rejected alternatives are in the openspec change `key-saw-learning-by-basket`.

### Why the three Half Decent Scale transports stay separate

`decent`, `decent-wifi` and `decent-usb` are one physical scale, and collapsing them into one SAW bucket looks free: `sensorLag()` returns an identical 0.38 s for all three, and the sample cadence is ~100 ms on both (BLE notify measured off shot 1091's settling samples at ~104 ms; the WiFi driver requests `rate 10k` and logs the ack). **It is not free — it was measured and refused.** Per-shot lag (drip ÷ flow) over 31 shots on one profile and basket, with the transports interleaved through the history rather than forming eras:

| group | n | median lag | range |
|---|---|---|---|
| BT (`decent`) | 13 | 0.598 s | 0.224–0.824 |
| WiFi (`decent-wifi`) | 18 | 0.840 s | 0.638–1.223 |
| BT, flow 1.30–1.70 g/s | 10 | 0.591 s | 0.224–0.734 |
| WiFi, flow 1.30–1.70 g/s | 7 | 0.848 s | 0.755–0.914 |

0.242 s apart — 0.36 g of drip at 1.5 g/s. Only 16 of 234 cross pairs have BT above WiFi (Mann-Whitney z = −4.04), and in the matched flow band the two ranges do not overlap. Four consecutive-day shots with bean, grind, dose, basket and profile all fixed: WiFi 0.879 (1089) and 1.016 (1092) against BT 0.584 (1090) and 0.658 (1091).

Which layer owns the 0.24 s is **not** established. TCP_NODELAY and DSCP EF are already set and read back (`decentscalewifi.cpp:1008`), so Nagle is excluded; cadence parity excludes a lower publish rate; a cross-correlation of DE1 flow against scale flow could not measure it (DE1 `flow` is water into the puck, scale flow is liquid out, and puck compliance decouples them — two of four shots correlated at |r| < 0.1). The leading hypothesis is batching or extra smoothing in the scale's WiFi firmware path, which would also explain WiFi's lower lag variance. Treat that as unproven. What is proven is the 0.242 s, and it is why the split stays.

## Algorithm Details

### Read path

```
sawLearnedLagFor(profile, scale, basket):
  if perProfileSawHistory(profile, scale, basket).size ≥ kSawMinMediansForGraduation:
    return mean(drip / flow over last 3 medians)        ← perProfile
  if globalSawBootstrapLag(scale) > 0:
    return globalSawBootstrapLag(scale)                 ← globalBootstrap
  return sawLearnedLag()                                ← globalPool / scaleDefault

sawModelSource(profile, scale, basket):
  → "perProfile" | "globalBootstrap" | "globalPool" | "scaleDefault"

An empty scale or basket argument RESOLVES (currentScaleType() / currentBasketKey()) —
see the class comment in settings_calibration.h. The learning path is the exception and
takes both latched, from espressoCycleStarted.
```

`getExpectedDripFor` mirrors `getExpectedDrip`'s recency- and flow-similarity-weighted regression, but on the per-pair history when available. The flow-similarity weighting is what handles within-profile flow variation (e.g. shot 1054's 2.5× end-flow): the predictor weights past shots whose flow rate is close to the current shot's flow rate.

### Write path

```
addSawLearningPoint(drip, flow, scale, overshoot, profile):
  apply existing entry-level guards:                ← unchanged
    drip < 0 or flow < 0       → reject
    drip / flow > 4 s          → reject (implausible BLE lag)
    converged + |drip - expected| > max(3, expected)  → reject

  if profile is empty:                              ← legacy path preserved
    append to global pool, trim 50, save
    return

  append entry to perProfileBatch[profile::scale]
  if pending.size < 3:
    log "[SAW] accumulated drip=… flow=… (n/3) lag=…"
    return

  compute median drip, flow, overshoot, lag
  if any |lag - median_lag| > 1.5 s:
    log "[SAW] batch rejected — outlier lag=… deviates …s > …s from median …"
    drop pending, return

  if median_overshoot < -6 g and last committed median for pair was also < -6 g:
    log "[SAW] 2nd consecutive overshoot<-6g … clearing committed history"
    perProfileSawHistory[pair] := []                ← per-pair auto-reset

  append median entry to perProfileSawHistory[pair], trim 10
  append same median to global pool, trim 50
  clear pending
  recomputeGlobalSawBootstrap(scale)
  emit sawLearnedLagChanged()
```

### Why batched, with median

Per-shot updates create a feedback loop: each update changes the predicted-drip threshold, which changes when the stop command fires, which changes the observed drip. The model partially chases its own tail.

Batching to N=3 holds the model constant for 3 shots, so the 3 ideals are pulled under identical conditions and are directly comparable. Taking the **median** of those 3 ideals is a built-in outlier filter: a single bad shot (channeling, scale glitch, manual stop, runaway) cannot move the model.

Flow calibration uses N=5 for the same reason, but SAW has no feedback loop: a stop command does not alter pump pressure or flow dynamics for the next shot. Because the model update cannot shift the conditions it is measuring, N=3 converges 2× faster with equal or better accuracy. A post-hoc simulation over real shot data (Apr 2026) confirmed this: N=3 graduated D-Flow/Q at shot 6 vs never within 9 shots for N=5 (outlier in shot 3 was cleanly isolated rather than absorbed), and graduated 80's Espresso at shot 3 vs shot 10.

### Why dispersion guards on top of the median

Median rejects single outliers but does not detect the case where the user changed conditions mid-batch (new beans, new grind setting). In that case all 3 ideals have shifted, and committing the median would lock in a half-changed model. The deviation gate (`|lag - median| > 1.5 s`) drops the batch entirely in that case, forcing the user to start a fresh batch under stable conditions. (IQR gating requires ≥ 4 values; N=3 relies exclusively on the per-element deviation check.)

### Why a global bootstrap median instead of just the scale default

A new profile starting from `sensorLag(scaleType) + 0.1 s` will be off until 3 shots populate its history (one batch). With `globalSawBootstrapLag`, it starts from "what we have learned about this user's machine on this scale across their other profiles" — a much closer prior. Flow cal uses the same idea (median of espresso per-profile multipliers) and it noticeably reduces the cold-start error.

## Settling and final-weight capture

After SAW fires the stop command, [`ShotTimingController`](../../src/controllers/shottimingcontroller.cpp) runs a settling state machine that watches the scale stabilize. The cup gains a bit more weight from post-stop drip (typically 0.5–1.5 g) before reaching its true final weight, and learning needs both `m_weightAtStop` (the trigger weight) and the settled value (`m_weight`) to compute drip and update the model.

### Stability gate and clean-avg capture

Each settling sample is added to a 6-sample rolling window. The "stable enough to commit" gate fires when all three hold:

- `avgDrift < SETTLING_AVG_THRESHOLD` (0.3 g) — window mean has stopped shifting
- `weight ≤ avg + SETTLING_ABOVE_AVG_MARGIN` (0.2 g) — current reading has caught up to the mean (drip has effectively stopped)
- `avg ≥ m_weightAtStop − 0.5` — the average isn't still recovering from pump-vibration artifacts

Once the gate has held for `SETTLING_STABLE_MS = 1000 ms`, `onSettlingComplete` writes `m_weight = avg` and the learning point is committed.

After the gate has held *continuously* for `SETTLING_CLEAN_CAPTURE_MS = 250 ms` (≈ 3 consecutive samples at typical scale rates), each subsequent gate-firing sample also writes the avg into `m_lastCleanSettlingAvg` — the last-known-good settled value held in reserve for the cup-lift case below. The 250 ms minimum filters out single-sample transients where the rolling avg fortuitously satisfies the gate amid noisy settling (a corpus scan of 953 shots found 2/953 such false-positive transients without this guard).

### Final-weight on cup removal

If the user lifts the cup before settling completes, the cup-removal detector fires on a >20 g drop (single-step OR cumulative-from-peak). The handler **skips learning** (a corrupted weight stream can't teach the predictor) but the shot still needs a `finalWeightG` to persist.

Before issue [#1280](https://github.com/Kulitorum/Decenza/issues/1280), `m_weight` was left at whatever value the last accepted sample had. In practice that was often a *cup-lift spike artifact* that squeaked past the 20 g cup-removal threshold — e.g. shot 5470 persisted `38.5 g` even though the cup had actually settled at `42.3 g` for ~700 ms and SAW had correctly stopped at `41.2 g`. The AI advisor then reasoned from `yield=38.5, target=42` and invented a "you stopped manually" narrative.

The cup-removed branch now applies this fallback chain to restore `m_weight`:

1. **Last clean settling avg, if plausible** — the value captured by the stability gate above, **provided its overshoot above `m_weightAtStop` does not exceed `MAX_PLAUSIBLE_POST_STOP_DRIP_G = 5 g`**. Real drip is 0.5–3 g; a "stable" reading 10+ g above the trigger weight is almost certainly a scale fault (freeze, drift, sensor glitch), not a settled cup weight.
2. **Scale-fault snap-to-trigger** — if the clean avg was captured but failed the plausibility check, treat the entire post-stop weight stream as corrupted and set `m_weight = m_weightAtStop`. The corpus scan found one such shot where the scale froze at ~75 g during settling on a ~40 g target; without this guard the fix would amplify the glitch from "recorded yield wrong" to "recorded yield very wrong".
3. **`m_weightAtStop` floor** — if no clean avg was ever observed (cup lifted before the window filled), raise `m_weight` to at least the SAW trigger weight. Post-stop drip can only add weight; persisting a value below the trigger weight is physically impossible.
4. **Unchanged** — if the fallback can't help (no SAW trigger captured, or `m_weight` already above stop weight with no implausible clean-avg signal), leave it as today's value.

Learning is still skipped on the cup-removed path — corruption of the post-stop drip measurement is the only reason this branch exists. The fallback only affects the persisted `finalWeightG` (and therefore the AI advisor's `yieldG`, the visualizer export, and `DyeSettings::dyeDrinkWeight`).

### Offline replay

`./shot_eval --settling ~/shot_corpus/*.json` parses the `app.data.debug_log` embedded in each saved shot and replays the settling sample stream offline, printing `recorded` (today's `finalWeightG`) vs `postFix` (what the new fallback chain would persist). Useful for scanning a personal shot corpus for affected shots — most rows will print equal values; cup-lift-mid-settle shots surface with a `***` flag.

## User Experience

- **Default ON, automatic** — there is no setting; SAW learning is always on.
- **Calibration tab** ([qml/pages/settings/SettingsCalibrationTab.qml](../../qml/pages/settings/SettingsCalibrationTab.qml)) shows the current effective lag for the active `(profile, scale, basket)` triple, the scale and basket it belongs to, and a source suffix: `(per-profile)`, `(global bootstrap)`, `(global)`, or `(default)`. The lag and suffix bindings carry a dye dependency, because `sawLearnedLagChanged` does not fire on an equipment switch — without it the card named the new basket beside the old basket's number.
- Two reset actions in the same card:
  - **Reset profile** — clears every basket bucket for the active profile and scale, plus their pending batches. Visible when that scope has DATA to clear, NOT when its tier happens to be winning: gating on the tier hid it exactly when the number came from a global tier, leaving the full wipe as the only button on the card, one tap, no confirmation. A per-BASKET reset was built and removed — the card names one basket at a time, so a third button bought a granularity nobody asked for.
  - **Reset all** — clears every SAW key (global pool, all per-pair history + batch, all bootstrap values, the basket-seed flag, hot-water SAW offset). **Behind a confirmation**, unlike the scoped reset: it discards months of learning for every profile and scale the user owns.
- MCP tools: `reset_saw_learning` (existing, now clears the new keys too) and `reset_saw_learning_for_profile` (new, takes optional `profileFilename` and `scaleType` arguments).

## Logging

Two audiences. **System log** (qDebug/qWarning) for live debugging. **Per-shot debug log** ([src/history/shotdebuglogger.cpp](../../src/history/shotdebuglogger.cpp)), which captures qDebug output via Qt's message handler hook so any single shot's debug log is self-contained for accuracy analysis.

System log lines:

| Event | Format |
|-------|--------|
| Entry accepted into batch | `[SAW] accumulated drip=… flow=… for <profile>::<scale>::<basket> (n/3) lag=…` |
| Batch rejected (dispersion) | `[SAW] batch rejected — outlier lag=… deviates …s > …s from median median_lag=… for <pair> — dropping batch` |
| Batch committed | `[SAW] committed median lag=… (drip=… flow=…) for <pair> — n_medians=k` |
| Auto-reset | `[SAW] 2nd consecutive overshoot<-6g for <pair> — clearing committed history` |
| Bootstrap recompute | `[SAW] global bootstrap lag for <scale> updated to … (median of n graduated pairs)` |
| Reset (per-pair / all) | `[SAW] reset perProfileHistory for <pair>` / `[SAW] reset all SAW learning` |

Per-shot debug log adds two key lines (and the system log lines above are also captured here, since the shot debug logger hooks the global message handler):

- `[SAW] model: source=<…> lag=… profile=<…> scale=<…> basket=<…> historyN=k` — emitted at extraction start when WeightProcessor's snapshot is taken. Records which model is driving the prediction for *this* shot, including the basket whose bucket it came from.
- `[SAW] accuracy: predictedDrip=… actualDrip=… delta=… overshoot=… flow=… scale=… profile=… basket=…` — emitted at settling completion. Headline number for "did SAW work for this shot."

Together, opening any saved shot via the Shot Detail page or the `shots_get_debug_log` MCP tool is enough to reconstruct what model the controller used, how accurate it was, and whether this shot fed the model.

## Storage Migration

No explicit migration. The new keys are written lazily as users pull shots; the legacy `saw/learningHistory` continues to be read as the fallback global pool. Existing users do not lose any data and do not need to re-learn — they just gradually accumulate per-pair history alongside the global pool.

A user who hits "Reset all" gets a clean slate (legacy + new keys both wiped) and starts fresh with the new architecture.

## Why the yield-ratio anchor (add-yield-ratio-anchor) needs NO changes here

A recipe/bag/session yield can now be a **ratio of the dose** that re-derives
the gram target whenever the dose changes pre-shot. SAW learning is unaffected
by design, and this section exists so nobody "fixes" the apparent mismatch:

- The model **stores no absolute target**. It learns a drip-vs-flow regression:
  `drip = m_weight − m_weightAtStop` ([shottimingcontroller.cpp](../../src/controllers/shottimingcontroller.cpp),
  the settling capture) is measured against the **trigger weight**, and
  predicted purely from end-of-shot flow. A 1:2 and a 1:3 shot on one profile
  teach the same drip model — correctly, since drip is a lag × flow quantity.
- The one target-dependent value, `overshoot`, uses `m_targetWeightAtStop`
  captured **at trigger time** (fed by `sawTriggered`'s live payload), so it is
  already correct against a target that moved — the `+10 g` mid-shot bump
  forced that property long before ratios existed.
- Learning being keyed per `(baseProfileName, scaleType)` while the target is
  per-recipe *looks* like a mismatch and is not: the flow-similarity weighting
  in the read path already absorbs ristretto-vs-lungo end-flow differences.
- The **resolved target** is latched at `espressoCycleStarted`
  (`ProfileManager::latchForShot`, called right beside the SAW model snapshot
  in [src/main.cpp](../../src/main.cpp)) and released at `espressoCycleEnded`,
  so the target the snapshot captures cannot move mid-shot — not from a dose
  write, and not from an anchor write or clear (a bean switch). Latching the
  dose alone was not enough: it left every write that changes the anchor
  itself free to move the target mid-pour.

- [src/controllers/shottimingcontroller.cpp](../../src/controllers/shottimingcontroller.cpp) — settling state machine, stability gate, `m_lastCleanSettlingAvg` capture, cup-removed fallback chain (#1280).
- [qml/pages/settings/SettingsCalibrationTab.qml](../../qml/pages/settings/SettingsCalibrationTab.qml) — Calibration tab UI changes (source suffix, per-profile reset).
- [src/mcp/mcptools_control.cpp](../../src/mcp/mcptools_control.cpp) — `reset_saw_learning_for_profile` tool.
- [tests/tst_saw_settings.cpp](../../tests/tst_saw_settings.cpp) — per-pair isolation, batch commit at N=3, dispersion-rejection, bootstrap recompute, fallback chain, reset behaviour, legacy-path preservation.
- [tests/tst_settling.cpp](../../tests/tst_settling.cpp) — settling-state-machine tests including the #1280 cup-lift-mid-settle regression replays.
- [tools/shot_eval/main.cpp](../../tools/shot_eval/main.cpp) — `--settling` mode for offline replay against a saved shot corpus.
