## Purpose

Defines how the favorites list is ordered — by the user's hand, alphabetically, or by recent use — and how existing users keep the order they built.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Favorites order setting
The app SHALL persist a favorites order mode with values `custom`, `alpha` and `usage`. When the setting is absent it SHALL resolve to `custom` if the favorites list is non-empty and to `usage` otherwise, without rewriting the favorites list.

#### Scenario: Existing user keeps order
- **WHEN** an upgraded install has favorites and no order setting
- **THEN** the mode resolves to `custom` and the favorites list order is byte-for-byte unchanged

#### Scenario: New user gets usage order
- **WHEN** an install has no favorites and no order setting
- **THEN** the mode resolves to `usage`

### Requirement: Stored list is the display order
Every consumer of the favorites list — the idle-page profile pills in both rendering paths and the picker's Favorites view — SHALL display the stored list order as-is. The mode SHALL govern who writes that order: `custom` — only the reorder dialog; `alpha` — the app re-sorts by title (case-insensitive, locale-aware) whenever a favorite is added or renamed; `usage` — the app re-sorts by each favorite's most recent shot descending, never-used favorites last alphabetically, at startup and after every shot save. The selected-favorite index SHALL keep pointing at the same profile across any re-sort.

#### Scenario: Usage mode after a shot
- **WHEN** the mode is `usage` and a shot completes on a favorite that was third
- **THEN** after the save that favorite is first in the stored list and first among the idle pills

#### Scenario: Selection survives re-sort
- **WHEN** a re-sort moves the currently selected favorite
- **THEN** the idle page still marks the same profile as selected

#### Scenario: Custom is never rewritten
- **WHEN** the mode is `custom` and a shot completes
- **THEN** the favorites order is unchanged

### Requirement: Favorites order dialog
The picker's Favorites… button SHALL open a dialog that states it sets the order of the idle-screen profile pills and offers A–Z, Recently used and Custom. Under Custom the favorites list SHALL be drag-reorderable with a remove control per row; under A–Z and Recently used the list SHALL show, read-only, the order the app will keep. Done SHALL write the chosen mode and, under Custom, the dragged order; Cancel SHALL write nothing.

#### Scenario: Drag to reorder
- **WHEN** the user picks Custom, drags a favorite from fifth to first and taps Done
- **THEN** the stored list places it first, the mode is `custom`, and the idle pills show it first

#### Scenario: Pick a derived order
- **WHEN** the user picks Recently used and taps Done
- **THEN** the mode is `usage` and the favorites list is re-sorted immediately

### Requirement: Mode switch semantics
Switching from `custom` to `alpha` or `usage` SHALL re-sort immediately. Switching back to `custom` SHALL keep whatever order is current at that moment; the earlier hand order is not restored.

#### Scenario: Round trip
- **WHEN** the user switches custom → usage → custom
- **THEN** the list stays in the usage order it had when the switch back happened

### Requirement: Upgrade merges Selected into favorites
The removed Selected list SHALL be folded into favorites once, at startup, before the favorites-order mode is resolved. The app SHALL compute the old Selected set from the two legacy keys — built-ins named in `selectedBuiltIns`, downloaded/user profiles NOT named in `hiddenProfiles` — and append every one that is not already a favorite, alphabetically by title, after the existing favorites, respecting the 50-favorite cap. The merge SHALL run at most once, gated by a persisted flag.

#### Scenario: Selected-but-not-favorite appended alphabetically
- **WHEN** the upgrade runs with two existing favorites and three old-Selected profiles not among them
- **THEN** the three are appended after the two existing favorites, ordered alphabetically by title among themselves

#### Scenario: Flag makes it run once
- **WHEN** the app starts a second time after the merge has already run
- **THEN** no favorite is added or reordered by the merge, and the favorites list is unchanged by it

#### Scenario: Cap respected
- **WHEN** the merge would push the favorites list past 50 entries
- **THEN** only entries up to the cap are added, the rest are left out, and a log line names how many were left out
