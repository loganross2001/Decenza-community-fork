## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Achieved-flow deviation check for flow-controlled windows
For a window classified flow-controlled, the system SHALL compare the window's measured mean
machine flow against the frame's target flow before computing a calibration ideal. If the measured
flow falls short of (undershoots) target flow by more than the configured threshold, the system
SHALL skip the window entirely — the shot contributes no ideal to the profile's batch — because the
window measured the pump model at an operating point the profile does not pour at, and a single
per-profile multiplier cannot describe two operating points at once. The check SHALL NOT trigger on
overshoot (measured flow above target) regardless of magnitude — a pressure ceiling can only hold
flow below its setpoint, never push it above, so an overshoot reading has no pressure-cap
explanation. The system SHALL log the skip with the measured flow, the target flow and the
deviation, so a shot that produced no ideal is explicable from a submitted debug log.

#### Scenario: Flow-controlled window achieves its target flow
- **WHEN** a window is classified flow-controlled and its measured mean machine flow is within the
  configured deviation threshold of the frame's target flow
- **THEN** the system computes the ideal as
  `currentMultiplier * meanWeightFlow / (meanMachineFlow * density)`

#### Scenario: Flow-controlled window undershoots its target flow (pressure-capped)
- **WHEN** a window is classified flow-controlled but its measured mean machine flow falls short of
  the frame's target flow by more than the configured threshold — for example, because the frame's
  pressure limiter is holding the pump below its flow target
- **THEN** the system skips the window, contributes no ideal for that shot, and logs the measured
  flow, the target flow and the deviation
- **AND** the profile's pending batch and stored multiplier are left unchanged by that shot

#### Scenario: Every window on a profile misses target
- **WHEN** a profile's shots consistently fail to reach the frame's target flow
- **THEN** that profile accumulates no ideals and its stored multiplier does not move, rather than
  being driven by measurements taken at an unreached flow rate

#### Scenario: Flow-controlled window overshoots its target flow
- **WHEN** a window is classified flow-controlled and its measured mean machine flow exceeds the
  frame's target flow by more than the configured threshold
- **THEN** the system does NOT skip the window — it computes the ideal as
  `currentMultiplier * meanWeightFlow / (meanMachineFlow * density)`, the same as a window that
  achieved target

#### Scenario: Pressure-controlled window
- **WHEN** a window is classified pressure-controlled
- **THEN** the system computes the ideal as
  `currentMultiplier * meanWeightFlow / (meanMachineFlow * density)`, unaffected by this requirement

### Requirement: Formula-version migration on behavior change
When a change alters how calibration ideals are computed, or which windows produce one at all, the
system SHALL clear all profiles' pending (not-yet-applied) batch accumulators as a one-time
migration under a version key, so no batch median mixes ideals computed under different rules.
Already-applied per-profile multipliers and the global multiplier SHALL NOT be reset by this
migration when the change is per-window rather than systemic, so users whose data does not exhibit
the defect are not forced back through several batches of re-convergence.

#### Scenario: App launches for the first time after the formula-selection logic changes
- **WHEN** the app detects it has not yet run the formula-version migration for the current logic
  version
- **THEN** the system SHALL clear every profile's pending batch accumulator and SHALL leave stored
  per-profile and global multipliers unchanged

#### Scenario: Upgrade to a build that unifies the ideal formula
- **WHEN** the app starts for the first time on a build where flow-controlled windows use the
  pump-model-error formula rather than a target-anchored one
- **THEN** the system SHALL clear every profile's pending batch accumulator, so no median mixes
  ideals from the two formulas
- **AND** stored per-profile and global multipliers SHALL be left unchanged

#### Scenario: Upgrade to a build that skips off-target windows
- **WHEN** the app starts for the first time on a build where off-target flow windows are skipped
  rather than re-routed through the achieved-flow formula
- **THEN** pending per-profile batch accumulators are cleared once and the migration is recorded
- **AND** stored per-profile multipliers and the global multiplier are left unchanged

#### Scenario: Subsequent launches
- **WHEN** the app starts again on the same build
- **THEN** the migration does not run a second time and pending accumulators are preserved

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Window ratio sanity guard
**Reason**: The two-basis guard is gone. It selected its comparison basis from the formula the window used (target flow for the flow branch, achieved flow for the pressure branch), and both premises are now false: there is one formula, and the re-route its second scenario described was deleted. Replaced by the single guard added below.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Single window ratio guard for both control modes
The system SHALL reject a window's ideal — before it is accumulated into any batch — when the
window's density-adjusted machine-flow-to-weight-flow ratio falls outside configured bounds. ONE
guard SHALL apply to both control modes, on the two quantities the ideal divides.

#### Scenario: Any window whose machine and weight flow disagree
- **WHEN** a window's density-adjusted machine-flow-to-weight-flow ratio falls outside the
  configured bounds, in either control mode
- **THEN** the system rejects the window, contributes no ideal, and logs the ratio, the bounds and
  the window's control mode

#### Scenario: Flow-controlled window that overshoots its target
- **WHEN** a window is classified flow-controlled and its measured machine flow runs well above the
  frame's target — which the off-target check does not reject, being undershoot-only
- **THEN** the guard still bounds it, because the guarded quantity is the machine flow the ideal
  divides by rather than the frame's target

### Requirement: One calibration ideal formula for both control modes
The system SHALL compute a window's calibration ideal as
`currentMultiplier * meanWeightFlow / (meanMachineFlow * density)` regardless of whether the window
was flow- or pressure-controlled. The system SHALL NOT anchor a flow-controlled window's ideal to
the frame's target flow. Window classification SHALL continue to select whether the off-target check applies, but SHALL NOT
select a formula or a ratio guard — one ratio guard, on the quantities the formula divides, applies
to both control modes.

#### Scenario: Machine whose reported flow already matches the scale
- **WHEN** a window's mean weight flow equals its mean machine flow times the density constant
- **THEN** the computed ideal equals the current multiplier, so a converged machine's multiplier
  does not move

#### Scenario: Same machine measured at two different multipliers
- **WHEN** the same machine and profile produce two windows at different stored multipliers, and
  the machine holds its reported flow constant by delivering water in inverse proportion to the
  multiplier
- **THEN** both windows produce the same ideal, so the update converges rather than tracking the
  current multiplier

#### Scenario: Flow-controlled window on target
- **WHEN** a window is classified flow-controlled and passes the off-target check
- **THEN** the system computes the ideal with the same formula a pressure-controlled window uses,
  and logs the reported flow, the frame's target flow and the current multiplier
