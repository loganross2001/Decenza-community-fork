// Resolves a profile to KB entries by its SHAPE, for profiles whose TITLE
// resolves to nothing (change: resolve-profile-kb-by-shape).
//
// The problem: a user copies a documented profile, re-tunes temperature or
// yield, and renames it to something the title steps cannot reach. The KB's
// suppression flags — flow_trend_ok, channeling_expected — are claims about the
// extraction SHAPE, and remain true of that copy, but nothing delivers them.
// The shot is then eligible for findings the named original correctly
// suppresses: it gets told a by-design curve is a fault.
//
// WHY ITS OWN TU, not shotsummarizer_kb.cpp: that file exists to be a lean
// KB-data layer over `:/ai/*` + QString, so the offline consumer that needs
// it — shot_eval, whose CMake source list deliberately excludes profile*.cpp
// — can link a small closure. (Only shot_eval: every tst_* binary reaches
// decenza_testlib, which compiles the whole Profile and BLE closure anyway,
// so this split buys them nothing.) Shape resolution needs
// Profile, which reaches Qt Bluetooth through profileframe.cpp's use of
// DE1::FrameFlag. Putting the index there would drag ~4,900 lines and a
// Bluetooth dependency into a curve-eval CLI. Keeping it separate costs
// nothing: the callers that need shape resolution (shot save, shot load, the
// profile catalog scan, and the dial-in difference block) all already have a
// Profile in hand.
//
// Consequence worth knowing: shot_eval does NOT do shape resolution, so the
// regression corpus gates the title steps but not this one. Widening it would
// mean giving that tool the Profile closure — see the note above.

// not name a file and a "distance to an entry" is not defined.

// delta lists, in which case the answer is named for the entry rather than for
// an arbitrary member of it. Same id but different numbers is still an
// abstention — the six tea profiles tie on row COUNT while each states a
// different "before" temperature, so there is no single true column to show.
