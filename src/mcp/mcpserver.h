// BUMP THIS WHENEVER THE TOOL SURFACE CHANGES — a tool added, removed or renamed, an
// action added to a merged tool, an argument that changes meaning. It is not the app
// version and does not follow it: 2.0.2 shipped a 97-tool server and then a 66-tool
// one, and a client reporting the app version would have shown the same string for
// both. `serverInfo.appVersion` carries the app version alongside it, and
// `serverInfo.buildNumber` the build -- appVersion is NOT the build and never was:
// v2.0.4 shipped as 3552, 3553 and 3554, because a pre-release is re-cut against a
// rolling version. This comment used to say appVersion carried the build; a field
// diagnosis was then unable to tell whether the fix it was chasing was present.
//
// This is a correctness obligation before it is anything else. The handshake is
// where a server states what it is, and a server whose surface has changed while
// its version has not is making a false statement on the wire — independently of
// whether any particular client acts on it. A client that DOES key on the version
// (today, or under the 2026-07-28 caching semantics) can only behave correctly if
// we tell it the truth; pinning "1.0.0" forever defeated exactly those clients.
//
// It does not, on its own, invalidate an existing cache: a client caches the tool
// list it fetched at initialize and refreshes only on RECONNECT, some not even
// then. This server declares no `tools.listChanged` and could not usefully send
// one, since tools are registered once at startup and never change while the app
// runs. The useful side effect is that a stale session becomes VISIBLE — a
// connector still reporting an old version is talking to a session that predates
// the change, which otherwise can only be inferred by counting tools.
