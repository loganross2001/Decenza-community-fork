// "Simulator" naming which one it is. These were three bare
// `qDebug() << "SimulatedScale: ..."` lines that no [Scale] search returned, so a
// sim session's scale view showed connects and tares from real hardware and
// nothing from the scale it was actually using.
//
// STDERR variants: ScaleDevice has a logMessage signal, but these three fire from
// contexts where the paired-emit adds nothing the marker does not already give.
