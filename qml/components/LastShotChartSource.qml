// The last shot's chart, as a background — one loaded shot and one rendered image for the
// whole app (add-last-shot-chart-background).
//
// WHY A SINGLETON. BackgroundSurface is instantiated once per page, once per chooser tile
// and once in the chooser's preview. If each of those loaded the shot, the app would query
// SQLite several times to draw the same picture; if each of them rendered the chart, it
// would run a GraphsView behind every page on a tablet. Both are held here instead.
//
// WHY AN IMAGE. The chart is static between shots — nothing on it moves while the machine
// sits idle — so it is rendered ONCE into an image and blitted from then on. Steady-state
// cost is one texture, the same as the photo background, and everything downstream of the
// grab is an ordinary Image: inert by construction, with no handler to forget to omit.
//
// What that trades away is freshness, and that is the real hazard here. A cached render is
// only correct until something it was drawn from changes — see `cacheKey`.

    // --- What the cache key covers -------------------------------------------
    //
    // A cached image is only valid while the things it was drawn from hold still. Keying on
    // them and re-rendering on a mismatch is deliberate: the alternative is remembering to
    // invalidate at each of the places below, and the one that gets forgotten is the theme,
    // whose symptom is the PREVIOUS theme's curve colours behind the current theme. That
    // does not look like a bug — it looks like a colour you half-remember choosing.
    //
    // NOT covered, and deliberately named rather than left for someone to discover:
    //   - Settings.app.temperatureUnit. The right-hand axis renders through
    //     Theme.cToDisplay/tempUnitSuffix, so a °C↔°F switch leaves stale numbers and a
    //     stale suffix on the wallpaper until the next re-render.
    //   - Theme.scale. It carries pageScaleMultiplier, which changes with NAVIGATION, so
    //     keying on it would re-render the wallpaper every time you opened a page. Stroke
    //     widths and label sizes therefore reflect whichever page was active at grab time.
    //   - The UI font family. A language change into a locale served by a platform fallback
    //     repaints the axis labels at different metrics.
    // All three are cosmetic and self-correct at the next shot. The header used to read
    // "Everything the render depends on", which is exactly the kind of claim that stops the
    // next reader from checking.
    //
    // Rounded sizes so a one-pixel resize does not trigger a re-render.
