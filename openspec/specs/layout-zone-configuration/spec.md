# layout-zone-configuration Specification

## Purpose
Defines per-zone layout options — alignment and theme-defined style presets (standard/accentBar) across every bar and center zone, plus item distribution (packed/equalWidth/spaced) on the bar zones only — along with the zone-options panel used to edit them, built-in populate presets (Brew bar, Compact status bar), and the reset-to-default action.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Open zone options in the editors

The layout editors SHALL let a user open a zone-options panel for **any** zone — by double-click or long-press on the zone (not on a widget) in the in-app editor, and by an equivalent zone-options affordance in the web editor. Zone options SHALL persist using the existing per-zone settings storage pattern (a zone-keyed map in the layout JSON, alongside `offsets` and `scales`).

#### Scenario: Double-click or long-press opens zone options in-app

- **WHEN** a user double-clicks or long-presses the body of a zone (not a widget) in the in-app layout editor
- **THEN** a zone-options panel SHALL open for that zone

#### Scenario: Web editor opens zone options

- **WHEN** a user activates the zone-options affordance for a zone in the web editor
- **THEN** the editor SHALL load that zone's current options and present controls to change them

#### Scenario: Options apply to all zones

- **WHEN** a user opens zone options
- **THEN** the panel SHALL be available for every zone, not only the new `lowerMidBar` zone

#### Scenario: Options persist per zone

- **WHEN** a user changes a zone option and saves
- **THEN** that option SHALL be stored per zone in the layout JSON and SHALL survive app restarts
- **AND** other zones SHALL be unaffected

### Requirement: Populate a zone from a built-in preset

The zone-options panel SHALL offer a "populate from preset" action that fills a zone with a built-in widget arrangement in one step. The set of presets SHALL include a **"Brew bar"** preset that reproduces the PR #1364 view: the `profileName`, `scaleWeight` (context-aware data mode), `ratioQuickSelect`, `doseWeight`, and `milkWeight` widgets, with `equalWidth` distribution and the `accentBar` zone style. Populating SHALL set the zone's widgets and the relevant zone options together, and SHALL be available for the `lowerMidBar` zone.

#### Scenario: Populate the lower-mid bar with the brew-bar preset

- **WHEN** a user opens zone options for `lowerMidBar` and chooses the "Brew bar" preset
- **THEN** the zone SHALL be filled with the brew-bar widgets in order (profile, scale, ratio, dose, milk)
- **AND** the zone's distribution SHALL be set to `equalWidth` and its style to `accentBar`
- **AND** the result SHALL match the PR #1364 bar

#### Scenario: Populate is non-destructive to other zones

- **WHEN** a user populates a zone from a preset
- **THEN** only that zone's widgets and options SHALL change
- **AND** other zones SHALL be unaffected

#### Scenario: Populated widgets remain individually editable

- **WHEN** a zone has been populated from a preset
- **THEN** each widget SHALL be individually removable, reorderable, and (where applicable) per-instance configurable, like any manually added widget

### Requirement: Item distribution option

Each **bar** zone SHALL support an item-distribution option with at least the values `packed` (default, current behaviour), `equalWidth` (every widget gets an equal-width cell regardless of content width), and `spaced` (evenly spaced / justified). The default SHALL preserve current behaviour so existing layouts are unchanged.

The **center** zones (`centerStatus`, `centerTop`, `centerMiddle`) SHALL NOT support item distribution, and the editors SHALL NOT offer the control for them. A center zone sizes every item from a fixed cell (capped so its action buttons never stretch), which is exactly what `equalWidth` and `spaced` require it to abandon; with the cap kept, both values would be indistinguishable from each other and would have no effect at all on a zone containing only action buttons.

#### Scenario: Default preserves current behaviour

- **WHEN** a zone has no distribution option set (existing layouts)
- **THEN** it SHALL lay out widgets exactly as it does today

#### Scenario: Equal-width distribution

- **WHEN** a bar zone's distribution is `equalWidth`
- **THEN** every widget SHALL occupy an equal-width cell across the zone, independent of its content width

#### Scenario: Spaced distribution

- **WHEN** a bar zone's distribution is `spaced`
- **THEN** widgets SHALL be evenly distributed across the zone's width

#### Scenario: Center zones do not offer distribution

- **WHEN** a user opens zone options for `centerStatus`, `centerTop`, or `centerMiddle` in either editor
- **THEN** no item-distribution control SHALL be offered
- **AND** any distribution value already stored for that zone SHALL be ignored, including by the previews

### Requirement: Zone alignment option

Each zone — bar **and** center — SHALL support an alignment option (`left` / `center` / `right`) that positions its widgets when they do not fill the zone width. The default SHALL preserve current behaviour.

#### Scenario: Alignment positions un-filled content

- **WHEN** a zone's widgets do not fill the available width
- **AND** the zone alignment is set to `left`, `center`, or `right`
- **THEN** the widgets SHALL be positioned accordingly within the zone

#### Scenario: Alignment is ignored under full-width distribution

- **WHEN** a bar zone uses `equalWidth` or `spaced` distribution (which already fill the width)
- **THEN** the alignment option SHALL have no visible effect and SHALL NOT cause layout errors

#### Scenario: Center zone alignment

- **WHEN** a center zone's alignment is set to `left` or `right`
- **THEN** its row SHALL be justified to that edge on the idle screen, not only in the previews

### Requirement: The idle screen honors every offered zone option

For every zone, the idle screen SHALL honor each per-zone option the editors offer for that zone. An option that is offered, persisted, and reflected in a preview SHALL take effect in the rendered home screen; conversely, an option a zone cannot express SHALL NOT be offered for it in either editor, nor approximated by either preview.

This forbids the dead-control state in which a user sets an option, sees it confirmed by the in-app and web previews, and observes no change on the idle screen.

#### Scenario: Bar zones honor distribution, alignment, and style

- **WHEN** `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight`, `lowerMidBar`, or `statusBar` has a distribution, alignment, or style option set
- **THEN** the idle screen SHALL render that zone accordingly

#### Scenario: Center zones honor alignment and style

- **WHEN** `centerStatus`, `centerTop`, or `centerMiddle` has an alignment or style option set
- **THEN** the idle screen SHALL render that zone accordingly

#### Scenario: An unsupported option is offered nowhere

- **WHEN** a zone cannot express a given option
- **THEN** neither editor SHALL offer that control for the zone
- **AND** neither preview SHALL depict an effect for it

### Requirement: Theme-defined zone style presets

Each zone SHALL support a **zone style** option chosen from named presets defined in `Theme.qml` (never hardcoded colors in the zone or widgets). At minimum the presets SHALL include:
- `standard` — the default; transparent background with the normal theme text styling (matches today's look).
- `accentBar` — matches the PR #1364 bar: an accent-filled background with contrasting text and emphasised (bold) values.

Each preset SHALL bundle the zone background and the text/value treatment so widgets in the zone stay readable on the chosen background across light, dark, and custom palettes. Themes SHALL be able to define their own preset values so the styles track the active theme.

#### Scenario: Standard preset by default

- **WHEN** a zone has no zone-style option set
- **THEN** the zone SHALL render with the `standard` preset (transparent background, normal text), identical to today

#### Scenario: Accent-bar preset matches the PR look

- **WHEN** a zone's style is set to `accentBar`
- **THEN** the zone SHALL render a full-width accent-colored fill using `Theme` tokens
- **AND** widget labels and values within the zone SHALL use the matching contrast color
- **AND** widget values SHALL render with the preset's emphasis (e.g. bold), matching the PR #1364 bar

#### Scenario: Style follows the active theme

- **WHEN** the user changes the app theme (light / dark / custom)
- **THEN** the selected zone style's colors and contrast text SHALL update to the new theme without further configuration

#### Scenario: Presets are selectable in both editors

- **WHEN** a user opens zone options in the in-app or web editor
- **THEN** the available zone-style presets (incl. `standard` and `accentBar`) SHALL be selectable
- **AND** the chosen preset SHALL persist per zone

### Requirement: Status bar zone honors per-zone options

The top `statusBar` zone SHALL render through the shared bar renderer so it supports the same per-zone options as the other bar zones — item distribution, alignment, and style preset — rather than a special-cased renderer. Its default rendering (no options set) SHALL remain visually identical to today, including its surface background.

#### Scenario: Status bar default unchanged

- **WHEN** the `statusBar` zone has no per-zone options set
- **THEN** it SHALL render exactly as it does today (surface background, spacer-distributed content)

#### Scenario: Status bar respects distribution and alignment

- **WHEN** a user sets the `statusBar` zone distribution to `equalWidth` or its alignment
- **THEN** the top bar SHALL lay its widgets out accordingly, the same as a bottom bar zone

#### Scenario: Status bar respects style preset

- **WHEN** a user sets the `statusBar` zone style to a non-default preset
- **THEN** the top bar SHALL render with that style's background and contrast text

### Requirement: Reset a zone to default

The zone-options panel SHALL offer a "Reset to default" action (alongside "Clear zone") that restores a zone's widgets and per-zone options to the default layout. For zones absent from the default layout (e.g. `lowerMidBar`), reset SHALL leave the zone empty.

#### Scenario: Reset restores default widgets

- **WHEN** a user chooses "Reset to default" for a zone present in the default layout
- **THEN** that zone's widgets SHALL be restored to the default set
- **AND** the zone's distribution / alignment / style / offset / scale SHALL revert to their defaults
- **AND** other zones SHALL be unaffected

#### Scenario: Reset of an empty-by-default zone

- **WHEN** a user resets a zone that is empty in the default layout (e.g. `lowerMidBar`)
- **THEN** the zone SHALL become empty

### Requirement: Compact status bar populate preset

The zone-options "populate from preset" action SHALL include a **"Compact status bar"** preset that fills a zone with `machineStatus` · `temperature` · `steamTemperature` · `scaleWeight` · `batteryLevel` (all with `displayMode: icon`) and a spacer-centred `sleep` widget. It SHALL be offered for the `statusBar` zone and SHALL set the zone's widgets together, non-destructively to other zones. The preset SHALL render with the existing status-bar renderer (no zone-style requirement).

#### Scenario: Populate the status bar with the compact preset

- **WHEN** a user opens zone options for `statusBar` and chooses "Compact status bar"
- **THEN** the zone SHALL be filled with the readout widgets in `icon` display mode plus a centred Sleep
- **AND** the result SHALL reproduce the #1362 compact bar look
- **AND** only that zone's widgets SHALL change

#### Scenario: Populated widgets remain individually editable

- **WHEN** a zone has been populated with the compact preset
- **THEN** each widget SHALL remain individually removable, reorderable, and per-instance configurable (e.g. flipping a readout back to `text`, or toggling the Sleep quit option)
