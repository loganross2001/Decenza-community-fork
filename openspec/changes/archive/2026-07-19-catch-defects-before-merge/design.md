## Context

The measured starting state (verified against the tree at `23042b54`):

| Signal | Where it lives today | When it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Compile | 6 platform workflows | `workflow_dispatch`, `push: tags: v*` |
| 83-test `ctest` suite | `linux-release.yml` only | same tag-push trigger |
| Text linters | `text-invariants.yml` | `pull_request` — the only such workflow |
| ASan | `CMakeLists.txt` ~200-217 | local non-Apple Debug builds; never in CI |
| UBSan | nowhere | never |
| Warning policy | `-Werror=unused-result` only | every build, since #1553 |

So the only automated check a pull request receives is three Python scripts that read QML as text.

Two incidents motivate the shape of this design rather than just its existence:

1. **#1553 took 53 commits.** The dominant defect class was a writer that could not report failure paired with a caller that announced success. Six review rounds each found a new instance in the previous round's fix. It was eventually addressed structurally with `[[nodiscard]]` plus a flag — which is the point: it became mechanically detectable only once the codebase annotated its own invariant.

2. **The flag from #1553 broke the iOS release build.** It was verified on macOS and Android; the offending call sat behind `#ifdef Q_OS_IOS`. Then the review of *that* fix found the same defect on the OpenSSL branch, where `-Werror=unused-result` had said nothing, because OpenSSL does not annotate `RAND_bytes`.

Read together: compiler enforcement is real but narrow and platform-shaped, and the project's actual gap is that nothing at all runs before merge.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- **`-Wall -Wextra -Werror` enabled by default on all six platforms.** This is the end state this change commits to, not an aspiration filed elsewhere. The staged path below is how it is reached without a six-platform outage; it is not a substitute for reaching it.
- Compile every pull request and run the existing 83 tests against it, before merge.
- Run those tests under UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, as the highest-yield detector whose reach does not depend on third-party annotations.
- Make the already-written ASan configuration actually execute somewhere.
- Drive the warning backlog to zero, tracked by an explicit exemption list that only ever shrinks.
- **Add no significant time to builds.** A developer's incremental build must not get measurably slower, and the pre-merge CI job must stay fast enough that nobody is tempted to merge without waiting for it. A gate people route around is not a gate.
- Record why compiler enforcement is not a completeness guarantee, so a green build is not misread.

**Non-Goals:**
- Flipping `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` on in a single commit ahead of the burndown. The end state is a goal; a big-bang switch is the failure mode, because it converts an unmeasured backlog into a simultaneous outage on six platforms with no way to tell the diagnostic that mattered from the noise.
- clang-tidy or static analysis. Higher setup and noise cost; revisit once the warning picture is known.
- Fixing what the *sanitizers* find as part of this change. UBSan findings are runtime defects in application code and are separate work; the warning backlog, by contrast, is explicitly in scope because `-Werror` cannot be reached without clearing it.
- Building all six platforms per pull request. Cost and latency are prohibitive; see the platform-coverage decision below.

## Decisions

### One new workflow, doing build + test + UBSan together

Rather than a bare "run tests on PR" job now and sanitizers later, the first job is instrumented from the start. The user's stated priority is UBSan on the existing suite, and there is no reason to pay for two separate CI wire-ups. `text-invariants.yml` is the working model for a `pull_request`-triggered job in this repo.

*Alternative considered:* add UBSan to the existing `linux-release.yml` test step. Rejected — it would run at tag time, which is after merge, and so would not prevent anything. It also couples sanitizer runtime to release latency.

### Linux as the pre-merge platform

The pre-merge job builds Linux x64 only. It is the cheapest runner, it is the platform where `ctest` already runs, and sanitizer support is best there.

The honest cost: this is exactly the blind spot that broke iOS. A Linux-only gate cannot see `#ifdef Q_OS_IOS` or `Q_OS_WIN` code. The mitigation is not to build six platforms per PR — it is the six-platform evidence requirement in the `compiler-diagnostics` spec, which applies specifically to the change class that has burned us (promoting a diagnostic), plus keeping the tag-push builds as the full-matrix check.

*Alternative considered:* matrix over all six. Rejected on cost and latency; a gate people route around is worse than a narrower gate they trust.

### UBSan first, ASan second

UBSan is cheaper (roughly 1.2-2x versus ASan's ~2x plus a large memory multiplier), and the defect classes it finds — signed overflow, bad shifts, misaligned loads, invalid enum and bool values — are plausible in a codebase doing DER encoding, BLE byte-wrangling, and fixed-point scale arithmetic. ASan's findings are more severe when they occur but its runtime cost is harder to fit in a per-PR budget.

So: UBSan in the pre-merge job; ASan on a nightly schedule, or per-PR only if the measured runtime allows. The decision is deferred to the implementation task that measures it, rather than guessed here.

### Sanitizer must halt, not warn

By default UBSan prints a diagnostic and continues, so an instrumented run can report undefined behaviour and still exit zero. Set `UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_error=1` so a finding actually fails the job. A detector that reports into a passing build is the same silent-failure shape this whole effort exists to remove.

### `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` goes on immediately, with a shrinking exemption list

Enable the full flag set on day one. For each diagnostic class that currently has occurrences, add a matching `-Wno-<name>` to a single, clearly-labelled block in `CMakeLists.txt`. Everything not on that list is a hard error from the first commit.

The list is the backlog. Its length is the remaining work, it is visible in the build file rather than a CI artifact, and each stage of the cleanup is one commit that deletes one entry and fixes that class across the tree. The change completes when the block is empty and can be deleted — there is no separate switch-flipping event at the end, because the flags have been on the whole time.

This is why there is **no advisory warnings job**. An earlier draft had one, plus a count baseline and a ratchet that failed CI if the total rose. All three are unnecessary:

- *Measuring the backlog* is a one-off. Run `-Wall -Wextra` once per platform, read the diagnostic names, write the `-Wno-` list. That is a task, not a standing job.
- *The ratchet* is subsumed. Any class not on the exemption list is already `-Werror`, so new warnings in cleared classes fail the build immediately — strictly stronger than failing when a count rises, and with no baseline file to maintain or race.
- *A dashboard nobody acts on* was the real risk. A number in a CI log has no forcing function; a `-Wno-` line in the build file is visible to everyone who opens it and is obviously debt.

The one thing the exemption list does not cover is a *new* warning in a class that is still exempt. That is an accepted gap: it is bounded by how long the list survives, and closing it would need the count-baseline machinery this decision exists to avoid.

*Alternative considered:* advisory job, baseline count, ratchet, then a blanket flip at zero. Rejected as above — more moving parts, weaker enforcement during the burndown, and it ends with the single highest-risk commit of the whole effort.

*Alternative considered:* fix everything first, then enable. Rejected — leaves the tree unprotected throughout, so cleared classes silently refill.

### Build time is a constraint, not an afterthought

`-Wall -Wextra` costs effectively nothing: the analyses run during normal semantic analysis whether or not the diagnostics are printed. The real build-time risks in this change are the sanitizer and the new CI job, and both are scoped accordingly:

- **UBSan is opt-in and off by default.** `ENABLE_UBSAN=ON` is set by the CI job and by developers who want it; a normal local build is byte-for-byte as fast as today.
- **The pre-merge job is one platform with ccache**, and `cancel-in-progress` kills superseded runs. Task 2.1 measures the instrumented suite before the job is allowed to become a required check, and 4.4 forces an explicit decision if it blows the budget rather than letting it drift into a long wait.

### The two slow tests set the budget

`tst_dbmigration` and `tst_coffeebags` run ~350 s each and dominate the ~6 minute suite; `tst_settling` and `tst_decentscalewifi` are documented as timing-sensitive and already need `--repeat until-pass:3`. Under UBSan all of this gets worse. The implementation must measure the instrumented runtime first and, if it blows the budget, choose deliberately between a longer job, a subset for the sanitized run, or moving the slow pair to nightly — recording which, rather than letting the job quietly become a ten-minute wait.

### A clean first run is a reason to strengthen the detectors, not to relax

The first instrumented run found nothing. Two readings are available and they are not distinguishable from the result alone: the codebase executes no undefined behaviour under test, or the sanitizer is not actually doing anything. That ambiguity is permanent — every future green run will have it too — and it is the same silent-failure shape as a writer that cannot report failure and a caller that announces success, which is the defect class this whole effort started from.

So the response to a clean run is four changes that either close the ambiguity or widen the net:

**A canary that proves the sanitizer is armed.** `tests/sanitizer_canary.cpp` commits deliberate signed overflow; `run_sanitizer_canary.cmake` fails the suite unless the process both dies *and* prints a diagnostic. Checking the exit code alone would not do — a canary that failed to link also exits non-zero, and would be read as proof the sanitizer works. Registered only under `ENABLE_UBSAN`, so ordinary builds never see it.

**Failing by construction rather than by environment.** `-fno-sanitize-recover=all` moves "a finding fails the run" out of the workflow's `UBSAN_OPTIONS` and into the build itself. The env var was doing real work — measured, a deliberate overflow exits 0 without it and 134 with it — but it lives in a YAML file where an unrelated edit can drop it, and it is absent from a developer's local run entirely, so the same code could report UB and exit zero on a laptop while failing in CI. The variable stays as belt-and-braces; it is no longer the mechanism.

**Two more check groups, and a deliberate refusal of a third.** `local-bounds` and `float-divide-by-zero` are added: both are real defects in this codebase's terms, the latter because dividing by zero in flow, pressure or ratio arithmetic is a bug every time even though IEEE 754 defines it. The `integer` group — unsigned overflow, implicit conversions — is refused. It is legal, well-defined C++ that CRC and hashing code wraps on purpose, so enabling it would report intent as though it were a defect, and a detector that cries wolf gets switched off. That costs more than it finds.

**The gap both sanitizers share.** An out-of-bounds `std::vector`/`QVector` `operator[]` whose index still lands inside the allocation is invisible to *both*: ASan sees validly-owned memory, UBSan sees no language-level UB. The read returns garbage that propagates into a shot. Hardened standard-library mode (`_LIBCPP_HARDENING_MODE`, `_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS`) traps it — verified against a plain build, which prints garbage and exits 0. `QT_FORCE_ASSERTS` closes the companion gap: the instrumented job configures a Release-type build, where every `Q_ASSERT` in Qt's code and ours compiles to nothing, so the invariants they document would go unchecked in exactly the run built to check invariants.

The honest limit on all of this: sanitizers only see code the tests execute. Strengthening the instrumentation raises the yield *per executed line*; it does nothing for the lines no test reaches, and test coverage here is unmeasured. ThreadSanitizer is the remaining untouched class — 31 files use threads and 25 do background-thread database work, which is exactly the shape that produces races — and no detector in this change covers it.

### What the gate has and has not caught — stated accurately

An earlier draft of this section was headed "the gate justified itself on its first run". That was an overclaim and is corrected here, because the record matters more than the narrative.

Both failures below were **self-inflicted**: neither is a pre-existing defect in the product. The `vptr` link break exists only because enabling UBSan introduced it, and the `local-bounds` rejection exists only because the flag list was wrong. The one genuine product bug found during this work — the screensaver cache-migration silent failure — came from the `-Wall -Wextra` measurement, which is **not part of this job at all**.

So, to date: **the pre-merge job has found zero pre-existing defects.** It has demonstrated that it *can* catch Linux-only compile and link failures, which is worth something, but that is a capability demonstration, not a bug count.

An earlier version of this section argued that "the 83 tests currently gate nothing", since `ctest` runs only on a release tag. **That framing was wrong in practice**: the full suite is always run locally before a pull request is opened. The tests are already gated — by process rather than by CI — so "a PR can merge with a failing suite" describes a theoretical hole, not the one this project actually has.

What that leaves is narrower, and it is worth being exact about it. Local runs happen on **macOS/clang**. Nobody compiles Linux/GCC, Windows/MSVC, iOS or Android before opening a pull request; those five platforms are first compiled at release-tag time, *after* merge. So the gap is not test coverage at all — it is **cross-toolchain compile coverage**, and the job's real contribution is being a second compiler.

That contribution is demonstrated rather than hypothetical: both breaks below are things a macOS test run cannot catch, however diligently performed. But it should not be oversold either. GCC is one of five uncovered toolchains, and the platform that actually caused the motivating incident (#1558, iOS) remains uncovered. The 45-second test step is kept because it is nearly free and covers the exception to the local-testing norm rather than the norm itself — not because the norm is unreliable.

Note also that the incident which motivated this change, #1558, was `#ifdef Q_OS_IOS` code. **A Linux-only gate would not have caught it**, and will not catch the next iOS or Windows break. That limitation is real and is not softened by the two findings below.

### The two Linux-only breaks it did catch

The first pre-merge run on real CI **failed at link**, on Linux, on a tree that builds and tests clean on macOS:

```
/usr/bin/ld: decentscalewifi.cpp.o: undefined reference to `typeinfo for QWebSocketPrivate'
```

UBSan's `vptr` check (part of the default `undefined` group) instruments downcasts through a polymorphic hierarchy and needs the target type's typeinfo at link time. `decentscalewifi.cpp` downcasts `QObjectPrivate*` to `QWebSocketPrivate*` to reach the inner `QTcpSocket` and set DSCP/TCP_NODELAY. Qt does not export typeinfo for its private classes on Linux; Apple's toolchain emits it, so macOS links and Linux does not.

This is the same shape as the `-Werror=unused-result` iOS break that motivated the six-platform rule — a change verified on one platform, broken on another, invisible until something compiled it there. The difference is that this time it was caught **before merge, by the gate, on its first run**, rather than at a release tag. That is the entire argument for the change, demonstrated rather than asserted.

The fix is `-fno-sanitize=vptr`, which is a requirement rather than a preference: the check cannot function against a library that does not export the typeinfo it needs. The cost is stated in the build file rather than buried — bad-downcast detection is now off everywhere, **including for that very downcast**, whose validity rests on a convention the code's own comment says to re-verify on every Qt upgrade. `vptr` is precisely the check that would have enforced it. That is a real loss, and the alternative (not instrumenting at all, or rearchitecting the QoS feature) is worse.

Worth noting for the runtime budget: the failing run took **24m 45s** to reach the link step on a completely cold cache — no Qt, no ccache.

### Measured on real CI, green

The fourth run passed end to end at **13m 20s**, but that number was an artifact: every push up to that point changed the sanitizer flag string, and flags are part of ccache's hash, so each one invalidated the whole cache and forced a full rebuild.

The fifth run, the first with stable flags, is the real figure:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Total job** | **3m 20s** |
| Build step | 1m 36s |
| Test step | 45 s (83 tests) |
| ccache hit rate | **97.74%** (778/796) |

This is the number the "is it worth it at PR time?" question turns on, and at 3m 20s the answer is straightforwardly yes — it is far below the threshold where people start merging without waiting.

Two caveats on the steady state. That run restored from a pull-request-scoped cache, and PRs no longer save one (see the cache-budget decision), so once this merges the restore source becomes the `main`-scoped entry. A PR whose base has drifted from `main` will see a lower hit rate than 97.74%, so expect the realistic range to be a few minutes rather than a flat 3m 20s. Second, 97.74% reflects a build with no source changes to speak of; a PR touching a widely-included header will rebuild much more.

Two things the CI log confirms that no local run could:

- `sanitizer_canary ... Passed` **on Linux/GCC**. The instrumentation is proven armed on the platform that actually gates merges, not merely on the developer machine where it was written.
- `UBSan: local-bounds unsupported by this compiler, skipping` — the probe doing exactly its job on the toolchain that rejected the hardcoded flag, rather than failing the build.

### ThreadSanitizer is not usable here, and the reason is worth recording

Task 3b.6 asked whether TSan should join the set, given 31 files using threads and 25 doing background-thread database work. It was built and run rather than reasoned about. The answer is **no**, and without the measurement it would have looked like an obvious win.

The run produced **10,194 data-race reports** and aborted 5 tests. That looks like a goldmine until the reports are read: **9,568 of them (94%) pass through `QCallableObject` / `postEvent` / `QMetaCallEvent`** — Qt's queued-connection machinery. The dominant single site, with 4,653 reports, is a `requestDistinctCache()` handoff; the canonical shape is `SerialDbWorker::post()` doing exactly what the project's own concurrency rule prescribes: `QMetaObject::invokeMethod(m_context, task, Qt::QueuedConnection)`.

These are false positives, and the cause is structural: `nm -u` on the installed QtCore reports **zero `__tsan` symbols**. Qt is not built with instrumentation, so TSan cannot observe the mutexes inside `QCoreApplication`'s event queue that establish the happens-before edge between poster and worker. Every correct cross-thread handoff therefore looks like a race.

Making TSan usable would mean rebuilding Qt itself with `-fsanitize=thread` and maintaining that toolchain — a large, ongoing cost, for a signal that would still need the 94% filtered out. So TSan is **not** wired into CI. Recording the numbers here matters more than the conclusion: a future contributor who reaches for TSan will otherwise repeat the experiment, or worse, wire up a permanently-red job and teach everyone to ignore it.

The consequence is honest and should not be softened: **data races remain the one plausible defect class this change does not cover.** The mitigations that do apply are the project's existing rules — the `withTempDb` helper and the `QThread::create()` + queued-connection pattern — which are conventions, not detectors.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Sanitizer slowdown makes the flaky tests flakier** → The two clock-cadence tests already flake under CPU contention. Measure instrumented runtime before enabling; keep `--repeat until-pass:3`; if a test becomes unreliable under instrumentation, exclude that specific test from the sanitized run with a comment naming it, rather than dropping the repeat guard or the sanitizer.

- **Linux-only gate misses platform-guarded code** → Accepted and stated openly; this is the known hole. Tag-push builds remain the full-matrix check, and the six-platform rule covers diagnostic promotion, which is the case that actually caused a release break.

- **UBSan finds a pile of pre-existing undefined behaviour on day one** → Likely, given no sanitizer has ever run here. If the initial run is not clean, the job lands non-blocking with its findings filed, and flips to blocking in a follow-up once they are fixed. Do not merge a blocking job that is already red, and do not suppress findings to make it green.

- **Cache churn against the 10 GB repo cap** → A per-PR job adds ccache generations. `prune-caches.yml` fires on build-workflow completion and skips while builds are running; confirm the new workflow is covered by that logic, or the cap gets hit and every build goes cold.

- **CI cost rises** → A build per PR where there was none. Mitigated by one platform, ccache, and `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress` so superseded pushes stop immediately, matching the existing workflows.

- **False confidence** → The largest non-technical risk. A green pre-merge badge invites the belief that the code is verified, when the gate is one platform, one configuration, and a test suite of unknown coverage. The `compiler-diagnostics` spec requires this limitation to be written down; it should also be said plainly in the workflow file's own header comment, the way `text-invariants.yml` explains what its checks do and do not protect.

## Migration Plan

1. Land `ENABLE_UBSAN` in `CMakeLists.txt` — inert until requested, no behaviour change for existing builds.
2. Add the pre-merge workflow **non-blocking** (not a required check) and observe it over real pull requests: read the runtime, the flake rate, and the initial UBSan findings.
3. Fix or file whatever the first runs surface.
4. Make it a required check once it is green and its runtime is known.
5. Advisory warnings job, then read its output before proposing any `-Werror` promotion.

Rollback at any step is deleting a workflow file or setting the option default back to `OFF`; nothing here changes application code or release behaviour.

## Open Questions — resolved by measurement

Measured on macOS arm64 (M-series, 10 cores), Release + `-DENABLE_UBSAN=ON`, `ctest -j10 --repeat until-pass:3`, three consecutive runs. CI numbers will differ — the runner is slower and colder — but the *ratios* are what these questions turned on.

**Instrumented suite runtime — a non-issue.** 34.1 s, 31.8 s, 31.9 s across the three runs, against the ~30 s documented parallel baseline: roughly **1.1x**, well under the 1.2-2x the design budgeted for. The slowest tests are unchanged in rank and barely moved — `tst_coffeebags` 32.4 s, `tst_dbmigration` 28.8 s, `tst_decentscalewifi` 22.5 s, `tst_beanbaseclient` 10.2 s, `tst_scaleprotocol` 6.7 s, `tst_settling` 3.2 s, then everything else under 3 s. Note the ~350 s figure quoted in the proposal for the two slow tests is a *CI* number; locally they are ~30 s. Nothing needs to be subsetted or moved to nightly, so task 4.4's contingency does not fire.

**The initial UBSan run is clean.** Zero diagnostics, across all three runs, with `log_path` capturing anything the sanitizer emitted (no log files were produced at all). So the job can go blocking as soon as its CI runtime is known — it does not have to sit non-blocking waiting for a backlog to be cleared.

Because zero findings is exactly what a *broken* sanitizer setup also looks like, this was confirmed by negative control rather than assumed: a deliberate signed overflow compiled with the same flags reports `runtime error: signed integer overflow` and — critically — **exits 0** under UBSan's defaults, and exits 134 under the `halt_on_error=1` the workflow sets. The instrumentation works, and the design's insistence on `halt_on_error=1` is confirmed as load-bearing rather than defensive.

**No flake under instrumentation.** All 82 tests passed on all three runs; neither `tst_settling` (3.1-3.2 s, stable) nor `tst_decentscalewifi` (22.1-22.5 s) needed a retry. `--repeat until-pass:3` is kept anyway — it exists for CI contention, which is not reproducible locally.

**ASan: nightly, not per-PR.** Given the small test-time overhead above, the argument against per-PR ASan is not test runtime — it is that ASan objects never hash-match UBSan objects, so a second sanitizer means a second full compile and a second ccache generation on every pull request. The *build* is what does not fit the budget. Hence `nightly-asan.yml` on a 04:23 UTC cron, offset from the prune cron.

**`prune-caches.yml` needed naming explicitly.** Its `workflow_run` trigger enumerates workflows by name, so a new one is not covered automatically; both `Pre-merge verification` and the ASan job were added to that list and to the in-progress skip gate.

## The warning backlog is far smaller than assumed (macOS leg of task 6.1)

Measured by re-running all 567 first-party translation units with `-Wall -Wextra -fsyntax-only` (third-party `_deps` TUs excluded, since the warning options sit after the FetchContent blocks and are never inherited there). macOS arm64, Apple clang:

| Count | Files | Class |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | 6 | `-Wunused-lambda-capture` |
| 6 | 3 | `-Wunused-parameter` |
| 4 | 1 | `-Wunused-const-variable` |
| 4 | 3 | `-Wunused-variable` |
| 2 | 1 | `-Wunused-but-set-variable` |
| 1 | 1 | `-Wreorder-ctor` |

**27 warnings, 6 classes, 12 distinct files.** Every one is in a mechanical, zero-risk class — unused things and one constructor initialiser order.

This does not match the premise section 6 was built on. The staged design — flags on with an exemption block, then one PR per class to burn it down — exists because "the composition of the backlog is currently unknown" and a big-bang flip would "convert an unmeasured backlog into a simultaneous outage on six platforms". Now that the macOS leg is measured, the backlog it was protecting against may not exist: 27 trivial warnings can plausibly be *fixed outright*, in which case `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` goes on with **no exemption block at all** and section 6 collapses from a multi-PR burndown into a single change.

Two things must hold before acting on that, and neither is established yet:

1. **The other five platforms.** This is one compiler on one platform, and the count that matters is the union. iOS is the specific worry: its Xcode defaults suppress roughly fifteen classes today, so it is the platform most likely to be hiding occurrences — and it is the platform that broke last time. Windows/MSVC `/W4` is a different diagnostic set again and does not map class-for-class onto clang's.
2. **Test and QML-heavy TUs.** The sweep covers what the Ninja compdb contains for this configuration; a class absent here may still appear in a target this build does not compile.

Until those are in hand, the exemption-list machinery stays in the plan as written. What changes is the expected *outcome*: plan for an empty or near-empty block, not a long one. If the six-platform union is still this small, tasks 6.6-6.9 (burndown order, one class per PR, delete the block) are satisfied vacuously by fixing all of it at once — which is strictly better and is what the spec's end state asks for.

## Open Questions — still open

- Instrumented runtime *on the CI runner*, which is the number the budget in the `pre-merge-verification` spec actually refers to. Read it off the first real runs before flipping the job to a required check.
- Should the pre-merge job also run the three text-invariant scripts, folding `text-invariants.yml` into it, or stay separate? Separate keeps the fast linters fast; folding reduces workflow count.
