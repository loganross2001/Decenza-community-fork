# equipment-inventory-view Specification

## Purpose
Defines the user-facing Equipment window and idle-page entry point for browsing, adding, and removing-from-inventory the equipment packages a user owns, including how each package's basket and puck-prep components are summarized on its card and info dialog. Covers the idempotent layout migration that injects the Equipment button into existing users' saved layouts.

## Requirements
### Requirement: Equipment window
The system SHALL provide an `EquipmentPage.qml` that lists equipment packages with `inInventory = true` as cards, mirroring `BeanInfoPage.qml`. When no packages exist it SHALL show an empty state plus an "Add Equipment" button.

#### Scenario: Empty inventory
- **WHEN** the Equipment window is opened with no packages in inventory
- **THEN** it SHALL show an empty-state message and an "Add Equipment" button only

#### Scenario: Populated inventory
- **WHEN** the Equipment window is opened with packages in inventory
- **THEN** it SHALL show a card per package displaying the grinder identity (brand/model, burrs as subtitle)
- **AND** each card SHALL offer edit and remove-from-inventory actions

#### Scenario: Removing a package from inventory
- **WHEN** the user removes a package from inventory
- **THEN** the package SHALL be soft-deleted (`inInventory = 0`) and SHALL disappear from the inventory list
- **AND** bags and shots pointing at it SHALL continue to resolve to its identity

### Requirement: Idle-page Equipment button
The system SHALL provide an `EquipmentItem.qml` idle-page layout widget that navigates to the Equipment window, registered in all required places: `CMakeLists.txt` qml module list, `LayoutItemDelegate.qml` (render switch + label map), the layout editor palette (`LayoutCenterZone.qml`/`LayoutEditorZone.qml` widget list + chip label map), and `shotserver_layout.cpp` (web editor widget list).

#### Scenario: Default layout placement
- **WHEN** a fresh install builds the default layout
- **THEN** the default layout SHALL include an `equipment` item placed immediately after the `beans` item in the same zone

#### Scenario: Tapping the Equipment button
- **WHEN** the user taps the idle Equipment button
- **THEN** the Equipment window SHALL open

### Requirement: Idempotent layout-injection migration for existing users
`getLayoutObject()` in `src/core/settings_network.cpp` SHALL run a run-once migration that ensures an `equipment` item exists in the saved layout: if no item across any zone has `type == "equipment"`, it SHALL insert `{"type":"equipment","id":"equipment1"}` immediately after the `beans` item (or, if no `beans` item exists, append it to `bottomRight`), then persist the migrated layout once.

#### Scenario: Existing customized layout gains the button
- **WHEN** an upgraded user has a saved layout with no equipment item
- **THEN** the migration SHALL inject an equipment item next to their beans item and persist it once
- **AND** the equipment button SHALL be initially visible and movable thereafter

#### Scenario: Migration is idempotent
- **WHEN** the layout already contains an equipment item
- **THEN** the migration SHALL make no change and SHALL NOT add a duplicate

#### Scenario: Beans item absent
- **WHEN** the saved layout has no beans item
- **THEN** the equipment item SHALL be appended to the `bottomRight` zone

### Requirement: The equipment card SHALL display the package's basket
`EquipmentCard` SHALL show the package's basket on its own line (below the grinder
title / burrs), using the same typography and secondary-color convention as the
burrs line. When a package has no basket, the basket line SHALL be omitted (not
shown blank). The grinder SHALL remain the card title; the basket SHALL be a
subordinate line.

#### Scenario: Card with a basket
- **WHEN** a package has a basket item
- **THEN** the card SHALL render a basket line showing the basket brand + model

#### Scenario: Card with no basket
- **WHEN** a package has no basket item
- **THEN** the card SHALL omit the basket line entirely

### Requirement: The equipment info dialog SHALL include the basket
`EquipmentInfoDialog` SHALL add a basket `InfoRow` (label + value) showing the
basket identity, placed with the other equipment rows. When no basket is set, the
row SHALL be omitted.

#### Scenario: Info dialog shows the basket
- **WHEN** the info dialog opens for a package with a basket
- **THEN** it SHALL include a basket row showing the basket brand + model

### Requirement: The equipment card SHALL display the package's puck prep
`EquipmentCard` SHALL show the package's puck prep on its own line (a compact
summary of the set flags, e.g. "WDT · Shaker"), below the existing grinder / basket
lines. When a package has no puck prep, the line SHALL be omitted (not shown blank).

#### Scenario: Card with puck prep
- **WHEN** a package has a puck-prep item with flags set
- **THEN** the card SHALL render a puck-prep line summarizing the set flags

#### Scenario: Card with no puck prep
- **WHEN** a package has no puck-prep item
- **THEN** the card SHALL omit the puck-prep line entirely

### Requirement: The equipment info dialog SHALL include the puck prep
`EquipmentInfoDialog` SHALL include the package's puck prep — the set flags only —
placed after the grinder / basket / dial rows. The row SHALL self-hide when the
package has no puck prep. The derived `distribution` rollup SHALL NOT be shown — it
is an AI-only signal (advisor + MCP) and is kept out of all user-visible surfaces.

#### Scenario: Info dialog shows puck-prep flags, not distribution
- **WHEN** the info dialog opens for a package with puck prep
- **THEN** it SHALL show the set flags
- **AND** it SHALL NOT show the derived distribution
