## Context

See `proposal.md` — Why, and `analysis.md` for the measured tables.

**The stored entry is read four ways.** `sawLearningEntriesFor` returns the pairs verbatim to
the WeightProcessor snapshot that fires the stop — the consequential one; `getExpectedDripFor`
feeds `(drip, flow)` to the Gaussian smoother; `sawLearnedLagFor` reads `drip / flow`;
`recomputeGlobalSawBootstrap` divides each pool's newest pair and medians the result
(`globalSawBootstrapLag` is a plain getter and derives nothing). A fifth reader is inside the
commit itself: the outlier gate compares each shot's lag against `medianLag`. Anything that
changes how the pair is derived changes all of them.

**The evaluation instrument works.** An earlier draft of this document asserted that
`tools/saw_replay` / `tools/saw_parity` had drifted out of usability and had to be repaired
first. That was wrong on every count and is recorded here so it is not re-derived:
`saw_parity` compiles unchanged against today's headers (`basketKey` has a default argument on
both entry points), both tools already have CMake targets, and `saw_parity` drives the real
production functions. What was actually wrong is smaller and worse: that same default argument
meant the tool passed no basket, so every corpus shot landed in one pool and the tool was
measuring a key shape that does not ship. One line.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- A committed entry describes a shot that happened.
- The outlier gate compares against a lag some shot actually had.
- A corpus and a harness that can gate a future model change on real numbers.

**Non-Goals:**
- Changing the prediction form. Both alternatives are already on the record as worse.
- Changing σ, the recency schedule, the read window, the batch size, or graduation.
- Changing the basket segment of the key — see `proposal.md`.
- A settings migration. The entry keeps its shape.

## Decisions

### Store the median-lag shot's own pair, not a new field

`medianLag` becomes `medianOf(lags)`, and the commit stores the `(drip, flow)` of the batch
shot whose lag is closest to it.

The obvious alternative — add a `lag` field to the entry — was rejected. It makes the entry
self-contradictory the moment a reader trusts `drip / flow` instead (two of the three readers
do), it needs a migration for entries that lack the field, and it leaves the smoother with a
synthetic pair. Choosing a real shot fixes every reader at once and needs no schema change:
old entries keep parsing, they are simply less accurate until they age out.

Closest-lag rather than exact equality. The invariant is over the number of *usable* lags,
not `kBatchSize`: a shot whose flow is at or below 0.5 g/s contributes no lag, and
`sawLearningImport` writes a pending batch with no size validation, so an even lag count is
reachable today without that constant changing. When it happens `medianOf` averages the middle
two and no shot owns the result, so the search takes the nearest.

`medianLag` is then re-read off the chosen shot rather than kept as the averaged value. That is
what makes the gate and the commit log describe the same real shot in every case, instead of
only in the odd-count case.

A batch in which *no* shot had a usable flow is dropped with a warning, the same handling every
other implausible batch gets. The alternative — falling back to `medianOf(drips)` over
`medianOf(flows)` — would commit exactly the composite this change exists to remove, silently,
with a printed lag of 0.000 s, and the gate would pass it unconditionally by iterating an empty
list. A branch reachable only by fault injection that violates the invariant the rest of the
change asserts is not a fallback worth having.

`medianOver` stays an independent median. It gates the auto-reset, is never divided, and no
reader pairs it with drip or flow.

### Ship it on the correctness argument, with the numbers saying what it costs

Measured over 250 shots through the production code: −1.0% MAE overall, −2.3% mid-flow, +2.4%
worse high-flow (n=14), worst case unchanged, 111 predictions improved against 107 worsened.

That is not an improvement, and the change is not argued as one. It is argued as: an entry
that four readers divide or smooth must describe a shot that happened. The numbers are here to
show the correction is approximately free, and to stop a later reader citing it as a
performance result.

The alternative — hold the fix until it can be paired with a model change that does pay — was
rejected. It leaves known-wrong data being committed in the meantime, and it entangles a
correctness fix with a tuning decision that has already been reversed once for exactly that
kind of entanglement.

### Extend the corpus, and keep it honest about what it is

63 shots was too few to separate a 1% effect from batch-assignment noise; 250 is enough to say
"inside the noise" with confidence. Two things about the extension are load-bearing and easy to
get wrong later:

- **The device database has been renumbered.** Its id 815 is 2026-04-19 where the old corpus's
  id 815 is 2026-04-01. Matching by id silently pairs unrelated shots. The two harvests are
  matched by timestamp, found to be disjoint, and concatenated; the old ids are carried as
  `legacy_id` and offset by +10000.
- **`scale` is recorded verbatim, not normalized.** The same physical scale appears as
  `Decent Scale`, `decent` and `decent-wifi` across the corpus's span. Normalizing them would
  fabricate a pool maturity the device never had.

### Record the flow-bucket picture where a future proposal will find it

The high-flow bucket is 1.11 g MAE against ~0.36 g elsewhere, worst case 5.98 g. That is where
the model's error actually lives, and it is untouched by this change. The archive's low-flow
over-prediction (shot 887, now `10887`) and this corpus's high-flow error are both consistent
with the weighted average being too flat in flow — a hypothesis, not a conclusion, and the
harness now exists to test it.

## Risks / Trade-offs

**High-flow regresses 2.4%.** → Accepted. n=14, and the bucket's absolute error is dominated by
something else entirely. Documented in `analysis.md` rather than hidden.

**Old entries stay wrong until they age out.** A pool carries up to 10 medians, so a bad entry
can influence predictions for ~30 shots after the fix. → No migration: rewriting historical
entries would require the raw batches that produced them, which are not retained. The trim
resolves it.

**The corpus contains measurement artifacts.** Nine of 250 rows record a "drip" of 3.09–8.06 g,
which is not drip. → Kept, because the previous corpus's skip rule
(`drip ∈ [-0.5, 10]`) was kept unchanged so the two harvests are comparable. `analysis.md`
reports the tightened figure alongside (0.3233 → 0.3167) so the conclusion does not rest on
them.

## Migration Plan

No data migration. Forward-only: entries committed after the change describe real shots,
entries committed before it are left alone and age out under the existing trim.

Rollback is a revert — no stored state changes shape, so a reverted build reads the same
entries it wrote.
