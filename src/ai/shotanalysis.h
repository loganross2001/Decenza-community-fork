//
// Absence is the OUTER std::optional (std::nullopt → strict no-op,

// constructed ExpertBand is always a valid, cited band. `lo`/`hi` are
// each std::optional so a one-sided rail is first-class — a floor
// (e.g. Allongé "reach ~4.5 ml/s": lo set, hi unset) or a ceiling

//
// Construct via the factories below: they Q_ASSERT the invariants
// (lo<hi, positive bound, non-empty src) — in DEBUG builds only
// (Q_ASSERT is a no-op under QT_NO_DEBUG). The struct stays an
// aggregate, so direct aggregate-init is technically still possible;
// the "factories only" rule is convention + debug-checked, NOT
