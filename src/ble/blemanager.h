    // half too, and that half was written as bare `qDebug() << "[R2-diag] ..."`:
    // 17 lines under an ad-hoc debug-session prefix that no registered marker
    // matched, so a [Refractometer] search returned the driver's packets and NOT
    // the connect/churn story they were added to explain.
    //
    // There is deliberately no refractometerWarn: nothing BLEManager or main.cpp
    // reports about this device is a problem — the failures all belong to the
    // driver, which has R2_WARN. Add one when a call site needs it, not before.

    // A connect failure that REPEATS while nothing changes. Logs at its normal
    // tier for the first few, then drops to DEBUG until the next successful
    // connect.
    //
    // The failure is real every time, but the reconnect ladder retries forever,
    // so at a flat WARN an absent scale produced 46 "connection timeout" and 24
    // "unreachable" warnings in one 48 h capture — enough to train a reader to
    // skim past the tier that is supposed to mean "look here". The first ones
    // carry the diagnosis; the rest only carry "still absent", which the ladder
    // lines already say.
    //
    // `tier` is the level the message would carry if it were not repeating, so
    // the budget suppresses WITHOUT re-tiering: a WARN-only budget would have to
    // promote any narrative routed through it, making the quiet lines loud.
    //
    // Accuracy note, because the first version of this comment justified `tier`
    // with lines that do not use it: it cited the WiFi driver's "resolving again"
    // and "dialing remembered address" as the INFO half of a failing cycle. Those
    // are DEBUG (WIFI_LOG), were demoted in the same change that wrote this, and
    // do not go through the sink at all. RepeatTier::Info is therefore reachable
    // in source (main.cpp translates the sink's bool) but never produced at
    // runtime — the sole sink call passes warn=true. The enum is kept because the
    // no-re-tiering property is the right design and a second caller is cheap to
    // add; it is NOT kept because something currently needs it. Wire a narrative
    // line through the sink or delete the enum, but do not read this paragraph as
    // evidence that the INFO path is exercised.
    //
    // `source` names who wrote the line, so a driver routing through this class's
    // budget still reads as the driver. Without it the driver's suppressed lines
    // would be stamped "BLEManager" and a reader would go looking in the wrong
    // file.
    // Public for the same reason scaleDebug/Info/Warn are: code outside this
    // class emits lines belonging to this subsystem's failing cycle, and the
    // budget only works if it sees ALL of them.
    //
    // That was the defect. The manager's three ladder lines were budgeted and
    // DecentScaleWifi's three were not, so past the budget the manager fell
    // silent while the driver kept warning every 60 s — a repeating fragment
    // carrying neither the attempt number nor the outcome. Noisier than
    // suppressing nothing and less useful than suppressing everything.
    //
    // ONE store, deliberately: a second counter in the driver would be a second
    // policy, and resetRepeatFailureBudget() would not reach it, so a scale that
    // reconnected would re-arm half its messages.
    //
    // Two overloads, and the split is the point: the defaults that are correct
    // for this class are WRONG for everyone else, and a default cannot tell which
    // caller it has. While `source` defaulted on the public signature,
    // `scaleRepeatFailure(msg)` from any other file compiled cleanly and stamped
    // the line "BLEManager" — sending a reader to the wrong file, which is
    // verbatim the hazard logtags.h documents for a shared forwarder that
    // hard-codes its own name. The default was safe only while this was private,
    // and it stopped being private in the same change that kept it.

    // So: the convenience form is private and means "this class wrote it"; every
    // caller outside states both tier and source, because outside this class
