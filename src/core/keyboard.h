// The virtual keyboard / input method, as a type QML can be checked against.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// QML reached the input method as `Qt.inputMethod.commit()`. That works, and it is not a bug —
// but qmllint types the `Qt` object's `inputMethod` as a bare QObject, so every one of the 108
// call sites across 36 files was an unchecked member access. `Qt.inputMethod.comit()` would have
// been indistinguishable from the correct spelling until a user hit the line, and the failure
// mode is the quiet one: the in-progress word is simply not committed.
//
// Which brings the second, better reason. CLAUDE.md carries this rule:
//
//     call Qt.inputMethod.commit() before reading any TextField.text from a button handler —
//     otherwise the in-progress word is lost on mobile
//
// That was a convention with no home in the code. It has one now: this class is where the rule
// is written down, and `Keyboard.commit()` is greppable in a way that a property lookup on a
// global object is not.
//
// It deliberately does NOT wrap all of QInputMethod — only what QML actually uses. Add a member
// when a call site needs it, not in anticipation.

    // reproduces on a touch device with a predictive keyboard, which is why it kept coming back.
