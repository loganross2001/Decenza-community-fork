// Bringing a WeightProcessor to a known point in its TARE WAIT — the window between
// startExtraction() arming the wait and the scale's zero being seen to land. Shared by
// tst_saw and tst_weightprocessor, which both need it and previously carried
// byte-identical copies of all of it.
//
// The wait is worth a helper because getting into it is not one call: flow can start
// before the app's own tare lands, so markExtractionStart() grants a bounded run of
// arrivals that this class refuses to judge, and a test that does not feed those
// arrivals spends the grace on its own samples and measures something else.

// befriended: a test that read the constant out of the class could not fail when the
// constant moved, and this is the only statement of what the grace is worth in arrivals.
