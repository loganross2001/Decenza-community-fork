/**
 * Half Decent Scale over WiFi (WebSocket).
 *
 * Wire protocol: ws://<host>/snapshot. A frame is a weight snapshot when it
 * carries NO "type" field — a bare JSON object { "grams": <number>,
 * "ms": <number> }. Typed frames (status / button / power / rate / error)
 * always carry "type" and opt in via "events on". NOTE: a "status" frame ALSO
 * carries a "grams" field, so snapshots must be discriminated by the absence of
 * "type", never by the presence of "grams".
 *
 * Reports type() == "decent-wifi" so the scale-creation hot-swap path in
 * main.cpp correctly distinguishes a BLE Decent reconnect from a WiFi one
 * (otherwise the type-change guard would always recreate the driver, see
 * #1246 review #6). NOTE: ScaleFactory::resolveScaleType maps "decent" and
 * "decent-wifi" to DIFFERENT enum values (DecentScale vs DecentScaleWifi),
 * so it cannot be used to unify the two transports — downstream code that
 * wants "same physical product" semantics must branch on the string with
 * explicit cases for both (e.g., grinder-calibration baseline in
 * src/core/settings_calibration.cpp). transportType() returns "wifi" for
 * paths that need to distinguish transport explicitly.
