class Settings;

// Auto flow calibration + SAW (stop-at-weight) learning. Split from Settings as
// part of the Tier 3 domain decomposition (issue #860). Holds a non-owning
// pointer to Settings so sawLearnedLag() / getExpectedDrip() can read the current
// scaleType() without a public-API change. TWO read-only lookups reach through it now:
// scaleType(), and dye()'s cached basket identity via currentBasketKey(). Nothing else.
//
// SCALE AND BASKET KEY RESOLUTION — read this before adding a SAW call site.
//
// The per-(profile, scale, basket) reads take an OPTIONAL scaleType AND an optional
// basketKey: sawLearnedLagFor, getExpectedDripFor, sawLearningEntriesFor,
// sawModelSource, perProfileSawHistory and sawPendingBatch. Leave either empty and the
// class resolves it — scaleType via currentScaleType(), basketKey via
// currentBasketKey(); that is the correct answer and the one every other consumer gets.
//
// The basket is in the key because measured post-stop drip differs about 2x between
// baskets on one profile and scale, so a single model per (profile, scale) predicts one
// basket's drip for all of them. Evidence and the rejected alternatives are in the
// openspec change `key-saw-learning-by-basket`.
//
// Pass a value when you genuinely mean a SPECIFIC pool rather than the current one.
// The case that must never be converted to resolution is the learning path: main.cpp
// latches the key at shot start and passes it back ~40 s later, so a scale swapped
// mid-shot still trains the pool that made the prediction. (Other callers pass an
// explicit key today simply because they already hold the resolved value — that is
// harmless, not a second rule. Deliberately not enumerated: an exhaustive list of call
// sites in a comment is falsified by the next commit, and this file has already had
// three such lists go stale.)
//
// The rule is NOT applied to the per-scale-only entry points — globalSawBootstrapLag,
// setGlobalSawBootstrapLag, sensorLag, isSawConverged, sawLearningEntries. They keep a
// required key, so `isSawConverged("")` still silently means the empty pool while
// `sawLearnedLagFor(p)` resolves. That asymmetry is a wart, stated here rather than
// papered over: those five are internal/bootstrap paths whose callers always have a
// concrete key in hand, and sensorLag is static so it has no instance to resolve from.
// If you add a NEW caller of one of them, pass currentScaleType() explicitly.
//
// This is deliberately the inverse of the older design, where the key was a
// required parameter every caller derived for itself. Four consumers derived it
// three different ways: the learner wrote one pool while the Calibration tab
// displayed another and the AI advisor reported a third, each invisible from the
// others. Making the resolved answer the DEFAULT means a new call site is right
// by omission, and an explicit key now reads as a deliberate choice rather than
// as boilerplate.
