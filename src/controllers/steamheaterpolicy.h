// THE single derivation of the steam-heater target.
//
// Every path that writes ShotSettings to the machine, and every path that
// reports heater state, resolves through this class. There must not be a second
// derivation anywhere: `ProfileManager::uploadCurrentProfile()` used to hand-roll
// its own copy that knew only two of the five inputs, so every profile upload
// re-sent steam = 0 for a user with `keepSteamHeaterOn` off — silently undoing
// the heater state a recipe activation had just applied, because the upload it
// triggered was deferred behind `m_uploadInFlight` and landed afterwards. The
// user-visible symptom was "picking a milk recipe does not warm the steam
// heater". Centralising is the fix; keeping it centralised is what stops it
// coming back.
//
// The inputs the resolution reads are deliberately not duplicated into members:
// they are read live from Settings, so a caller cannot resolve against a stale
// copy. The one piece of state that does not live in Settings — whether the
// active recipe wants steam — is pushed in by MainController.
