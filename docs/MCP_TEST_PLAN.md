# MCP Tool Test Plan

Sequential runbook to verify all MCP tools work correctly as a second UI to the QML app. Each test has explicit tool calls, expected results, and cleanup steps. Tests must be run in order — later tests depend on state from earlier ones.

## Prerequisites

- App running (simulator or production)
- MCP connected (`/mcp` in Claude Code)
- Machine in Ready or Sleep state (not mid-operation)

## State Capture (run before tests)

Save these values — they will be restored at the end:
```
Call: profiles_get_active
Save: ORIGINAL_PROFILE = filename, ORIGINAL_MODIFIED = modified

Call: profiles_get_params
Save: ORIGINAL_TEMP (tempStart for recipe, espresso_temperature for advanced)

Call: settings_get
Save: ORIGINAL_BRAND = dyeBeanBrand, ORIGINAL_GRIND = dyeGrinderSetting
Save: ORIGINAL_BEAN_TYPE = dyeBeanType, ORIGINAL_ROAST = dyeRoastLevel

Call: machine_get_state
Save: ORIGINAL_PHASE = phase (if Sleep, will wake for tests then re-sleep at end)
```

If ORIGINAL_MODIFIED is true, warn the user — tests will modify the profile and the unsaved changes will be lost.

## Run Log

| Date | Tools | Passed | Skipped | Failed | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| 2026-03-20 | 37 | 41 | 1 | 0 | Initial run, simulator mode |
| 2026-04-30 | 33 | 56 | 1 | 0 | Simulator, MCP 2025-11-25 negotiated. Plan refreshed for PR #976 field renames, `profiles_save` readonly refusal, `profiles_create` empty-filename, removal of `preferences` category, and §4.10 active-delete behavior. |
| 2026-05-01 | 33 | 56 | 1 | 0 | Plan refreshed for PR #984: `shots_get_detail`/`shots_compare` default to summary mode (#979); `enjoyment0to100`/`drinkTdsPct`/`drinkEyPct` everywhere on shot reads (#980); `profiles_delete` returns actionable error on active profile (#983). |
| 2026-05-01 | 35 | — | — | 0 | Plan refreshed for PR #1014 (#1009): `dialing_get_context` now emits `dialInSessions` (sessions of shots within ~60 min on the same profile, with within-session `changeFromPrev` diffs) in place of the flat `dialInHistory` array. |
| 2026-05-01 | 35 | — | — | 0 | Plan refreshed for PR #1015 (#1010): `dialing_get_context` now emits a `tastingFeedback` block (`hasEnjoymentScore` / `hasNotes` / `hasRefractometer`, plus a conditional `recommendation` when any are missing). |
| 2026-05-01 | 35 | — | — | 0 | Plan refreshed for PR #1016 (#1011): `shots_list` accepts `hasRating` / `hasNotes` / `hasTds` boolean filters, composable with existing filters. New §6.2a covers them. |
| 2026-05-01 | 35 | — | — | 0 | Plan refreshed for PR #1017 (#1012): `detectorResults` from `shots_get_detail` / `shots_compare` now uses a uniform envelope shape (`pour { truncated, startSec, endSec, peakPressureBar }`, `skipFirstFrame { detected }`, `verdict { category }`); old top-level scalars removed. |
| 2026-05-01 | 34 | — | — | 0 | Spot-check after merging PRs #996–#1005 (issues #985–#994). Validated: `app_get_info` returns platform block, `machine_get_state` no longer ships `stateString`/`platform`. `shots_list` returns `hasMore`/`nextOffset` (last-page → false/null). `shots_get_detail`/`shots_compare` strip `gates` from detector results, emit `null` for unrated `enjoyment0to100`/`drinkTdsPct`/`drinkEyPct`, and `shots_compare` hoists `profileNotes`/`profileKbId` to a top-level `sharedProfile` block when shots share a profile. `profiles_list` filters (`editorType`, `excludeCategories`, `nameContains`, `readOnly`) and the derived `category` field work; trim + case-insensitive match catches `D-Flow`/`A-Flow`. `profiles_get_params` emits both un-suffixed and `*Bar`/`*C`/`*MlPerSec`/`*Sec`/`*G`/`*Ml` aliases (incl. `preinfusionStopPressureBar`). `settings_get` keys filter accepts suffixed read names (`espressoTemperatureC` round-trips); unknown keys/categories return structured error with `validCategories`/`unknownKeys`. `dialing_get_context` default returns ~1 KB profile section only; `includeFullKnowledge: true` returns the full ~18 KB system prompt + reference tables + catalog. |
| 2026-05-01 | 34 | 67 | 1 | 1 | Full plan run, simulator. All sections passed: §1 state/info/telemetry, §2 sleep/wake/stop/skip (start_* skipped per simulator note), §3.3-3.8 profile read for all editor types (with new aliases), §4 profile editing incl. frame preservation, save-as, built-in revert, active-profile delete protection, profiles_create. §5 settings get/set incl. unknown rejection. §6 shots list/detail/compare/update/delete (round-trip restored). §7 dialing default + full knowledge. §8 scale, §9 devices, §10 debug pagination, §11 settings parity for all 22 categories. **One failure**: §4.10 `profiles_delete` of `mcp_test_tmp` returned `Failed to delete profile` after switching active to `default` first — the user profile appears to vanish from the list when active is switched, even though `profiles_save` reported success and `profiles_get_active` confirmed it. Behavior may be a save-persistence quirk in the simulator path; worth a follow-up issue. Cleanup left no residue (default active, modified=false, DYE/system settings all back to ORIGINAL values). |
| 2026-05-01 | 35 | 68 | 1 | 0 | Re-run §4.9–§4.10 + new §4.9a after merging PR #1007 (#1006). Root cause was the test plan's old `_mcp_test_tmp` filename — `ProfileStorage::listProfiles` filters underscore-prefixed files (reserved for internal files like `_current.json`), so the profile got persisted to disk but was invisible to `profiles_list` / `refreshProfiles`, which made `ProfileManager::deleteProfile` see `source=BuiltIn` and return false even when the file was successfully removed. PR #1007 rejects underscore-prefixed filenames upfront in `profiles_save`. Re-verified live after app restart: `profiles_save (filename: "_internal_thing", ...)` → clear error suggesting `internal_thing` instead; `profiles_save (filename: "mcp_test_tmp", ...)` → success → visible in `profiles_list (nameContains: "mcp")` (count=1) → `profiles_set_active default` → `profiles_delete (mcp_test_tmp)` → `Profile deleted: mcp_test_tmp` → list count=0. All 11 MCP issues from this session (#985–#994 + #1006) closed. |
| 2026-05-01 | 28 | 70 | 6 | 0 | Full plan run, simulator, after merging PRs #1014–#1017 (issues #1009–#1012). All sections passed: §1 state/app_info/telemetry; §2 sleep/wake/stop/skip (start_* skipped per simulator note); §3.1–§3.8 list+filters+5 editor types' params with un-suffixed and `*Bar`/`*C`/`*MlPerSec`/`*Sec`/`*G`/`*Ml` aliases; §4 edit recipe & advanced w/ frame preservation, save-as, underscore reject (#1006), user-profile delete after active switch, profiles_create; §5 get all/keys/category, structured errors for unknown category & key, DYE round-trip, empty-payload reject; §6 list, profileName filter, **§6.2a hasRating/hasNotes/hasTds + composed filter (#1011) ✓**, **§6.3 detail with new envelope shape — `pour { truncated, startSec, endSec, peakPressureBar:null }`, `skipFirstFrame { detected }`, `verdict { category }`, no top-level `pourTruncated`/`pourStartSec`/`pourEndSec`/`peakPressureBar`/`verdictCategory` (#1012) ✓**, §6.4 compare with same envelope + `sharedProfile` hoist, §6.5/§6.6 update round-trips (enjoyment+notes, dose+barista), §6.7 invalid-id delete returns success (async-safe); §6.8 `shots_set_feedback` confirmed absent from MCP tools list; §7.1 default ~1 KB profileKnowledge + **`dialInSessions` (#1009) ✓ — sessions of 1, 1, 2, 1 reflecting 60-min adjacency, ASC within session, `changeFromPrev` on shot index>0** + **`tastingFeedback` (#1010) ✓ — `hasEnjoymentScore: false / hasNotes: false / hasRefractometer: false` plus the recommendation string for an unrated shot**; §7.1a full ~18 KB system prompt + reference tables + catalog; §8 scale_get_weight (tare/timer skipped — no scale connected); §9 connection status + list; §10 debug log session listing (68 sessions); §11 sample categories (machine/accessibility/screensaver/heater) returned the expected per-category fields. `dialing_apply_change` confirmed removed. Cleanup verified: active=default, modified=false, dyeBeanBrand=Northbound, dyeRoastLevel="", phase=Ready. Skipped: machine_start_* (4), scale_tare/timer (3 — no scale), §4.11 built-in revert (already validated previously). |

### 1.1 machine_get_state
```
Call: machine_get_state
Expect: phase exists, connected=true, waterLevelMl > 0, firmwareVersion non-empty, activeProfile non-empty.
        No `stateString` field (deprecated — use `phase`).
        No `platform` block (moved to app_get_info).
```

### 1.1a app_get_info
```
Call: app_get_info
Expect: appVersion, qtVersion, os, osType, osVersion, kernelType, architecture,

```

## 2. Machine Control

### 2.1 machine_sleep
```
Call: machine_sleep (confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true
```

### 2.2 machine_wake
```
Call: machine_wake (confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true
Verify: machine_get_state → phase is "Ready" or "Idle" (not "Sleep")
Note: machine must be awake for remaining tests. Will restore ORIGINAL_PHASE at end.
```

### 2.3 machine_stop (no operation running)
```
Call: machine_stop (confirmed: true)
Expect: error containing "No operation" or similar
```

### 2.4 machine_skip_frame (no extraction running)

Call: machine_skip_frame (confirmed: true)
Expect: error containing "No extraction" or similar
```

### 2.5 machine_start_espresso / steam / hot_water / flush
```
SKIP if simulator mode (not headless DE1)
On real headless DE1:
  Call: machine_start_espresso
  Expect: success=true, then machine_get_state shows espresso phase
  Call: machine_stop (confirmed: true)
  Expect: success=true
```

## 3. Profile Read — All 5 Editor Types

### 3.1 profiles_list
```
Call: profiles_list
Expect: count > 0, each profile has filename, title, editorType, readOnly, category
        (category is the title's slash prefix or null for espresso recipes).
Verify: editorType values include at least "pressure", "flow", "dflow", "aflow", "advanced"
```

### 3.1a profiles_list — filtered
```
Call: profiles_list (editorType: "dflow")
Expect: every returned profile has editorType="dflow", count smaller than unfiltered.
Call: profiles_list (excludeCategories: ["Tea", "Cleaning", "Pour over basket", "Test", "Visualizer"])
Expect: count is the espresso-only subset (significantly smaller than unfiltered).
Call: profiles_list (nameContains: "espresso", readOnly: false)
Expect: only user-writable profiles whose title or filename contains "espresso".
```

### 3.2 profiles_get_active
```
Call: profiles_get_active
Expect: filename non-empty, editorType non-empty, modified is boolean,
        targetWeightG > 0, targetTemperatureC > 0, readOnly is boolean
Save: note the filename and editorType as ORIGINAL_PROFILE and ORIGINAL_EDITOR
```
Note: target temperature field is `targetTemperatureC` (suffix), not `targetTemperature`.

### 3.3 profiles_get_detail
```
Call: profiles_get_detail (filename: "blooming_espresso")
Expect: title="Blooming Espresso", steps is array with length > 0, espresso_temperature > 0
```

### 3.4 profiles_get_params — pressure
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "default", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_get_params
Expect: editorType="pressure"
Expect present: espressoPressure, pressureEnd, preinfusionTime, holdTime, simpleDeclineTime, tempStart, tempHold, limiterValue
Expect also present (suffixed aliases per #992): espressoPressureBar, pressureEndBar,
        preinfusionStopPressureBar, preinfusionTimeSec, holdTimeSec, simpleDeclineTimeSec,
        tempStartC, tempHoldC.
        Each alias has the same value as its un-suffixed sibling — both forms round-trip.
Expect absent: fillTemperature, pourFlow, rampTime, steps
```

### 3.5 profiles_get_params — flow
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "flow_profile_for_straight_espresso", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_get_params
Expect: editorType="flow"
Expect present: holdFlow, flowEnd, preinfusionTime, holdTime, simpleDeclineTime, tempStart, limiterValue
Expect also present (suffixed aliases per #992): holdFlowMlPerSec, flowEndMlPerSec,
        preinfusionTimeSec, holdTimeSec, simpleDeclineTimeSec, tempStartC.
Expect absent: espressoPressure, pressureEnd, fillTemperature, pourFlow, rampTime, steps
```

### 3.6 profiles_get_params — dflow
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "d_flow_q", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_get_params
Expect: editorType="dflow"
Expect present: fillTemperature, fillPressure, fillFlow, infusePressure, infuseTime, pourTemperature, pourFlow, pourPressure
Expect also present (suffixed aliases per #992): fillTemperatureC, fillPressureBar,
        fillFlowMlPerSec, infusePressureBar, infuseTimeSec, pourTemperatureC,
        pourFlowMlPerSec, pourPressureBar.
Expect absent: preinfusionTime, espressoPressure, holdFlow, rampTime, steps
```

### 3.7 profiles_get_params — aflow
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "a_flow_default_medium", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_get_params
Expect: editorType="aflow"
Expect present: (all dflow fields) + rampTime, rampDownEnabled, flowExtractionUp, secondFillEnabled
Expect also present (suffixed aliases per #992): rampTimeSec, plus all dflow aliases above.
Expect absent: preinfusionTime, espressoPressure, steps
```

### 3.8 profiles_get_params — advanced
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "adaptive_v2", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_get_params
Expect: editorType="advanced"
Expect present: steps (array with 7 elements), espresso_temperature, profile_notes, preinfuse_frame_count
Expect absent: fillTemperature, pourFlow, preinfusionTime, espressoPressure
```

## 4. Profile Editing

### Setup: switch to pressure profile
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "default", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_get_params
Save: note tempStart as ORIGINAL_TEMP
```

### 4.1 profiles_edit_params — recipe profile
```
Call: profiles_edit_params (tempStart: ORIGINAL_TEMP+2, tempPreinfuse: ORIGINAL_TEMP+2, tempHold: ORIGINAL_TEMP+2, tempDecline: ORIGINAL_TEMP+2, confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true, editorType="pressure", modified=true
Verify: profiles_get_active → targetTemperatureC = ORIGINAL_TEMP+2, modified=true
```

### 4.2 Restore temperature
```
Call: profiles_edit_params (tempStart: ORIGINAL_TEMP, tempPreinfuse: ORIGINAL_TEMP-2, tempHold: ORIGINAL_TEMP-2, tempDecline: ORIGINAL_TEMP-2, confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true
```

### 4.3 settings_set — temperature on recipe profile
```
Call: settings_set (espressoTemperature: ORIGINAL_TEMP+2, confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true, updated includes "espressoTemperature"
Verify: profiles_get_active → targetTemperatureC = ORIGINAL_TEMP+2
```
Note: writing `espressoTemperature` mutates the active profile (creates a user override on a built-in). This matches the QML behavior — the brew temperature lives on the profile.

### 4.4 Restore temperature
```
Call: settings_set (espressoTemperature: ORIGINAL_TEMP, confirmed: true)
```

### 4.5 profiles_edit_params — advanced profile (frame preservation)
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "adaptive_v2", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_get_params
Save: note steps array length as FRAME_COUNT, espresso_temperature as ADV_TEMP
Call: profiles_edit_params (espresso_temperature: ADV_TEMP+2, confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true, editorType="advanced"
Verify: profiles_get_params → steps has FRAME_COUNT elements (frames NOT destroyed), espresso_temperature = ADV_TEMP+2
```

### 4.6 settings_set — temperature on advanced profile (frame preservation)
```
Call: settings_set (espressoTemperature: ADV_TEMP+3, confirmed: true)
Expect: updated includes "espressoTemperature"
Verify: profiles_get_params → steps still has FRAME_COUNT elements, espresso_temperature = ADV_TEMP+3
```

### 4.7 Restore advanced profile temperature
```
Call: settings_set (espressoTemperature: ADV_TEMP, confirmed: true)
Expect: updated includes "espressoTemperature"
Verify: profiles_get_active → editorType="advanced", targetTemperatureC = ADV_TEMP
```

### 4.8 profiles_save — refusal on read-only built-in
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "default", confirmed: true)
Call: profiles_edit_params (tempStart: 91, tempPreinfuse: 91, tempHold: 91, tempDecline: 91, confirmed: true)
Verify: profiles_get_active → modified=true, readOnly=true
Call: profiles_save (confirmed: true)   # no filename/title → in-place
Expect: error containing "read-only" — built-in profiles cannot be saved in place;
        Save As is required to create a user copy.
Note: §4.3 (espressoTemperature setter) is the path that *does* persist edits on a
      built-in by creating a user override automatically. profiles_save in-place is
      reserved for already-user-owned profiles.
```

### 4.9 profiles_save — Save As
```
Call: profiles_save (filename: "mcp_test_tmp", title: "MCP Test Temp", confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true, filename="mcp_test_tmp"
Verify: profiles_get_active → filename="mcp_test_tmp", modified=false, readOnly=false
Note: Save As makes the new copy active. Cleaned up in 4.10.
```

### 4.9a profiles_save — leading-underscore filename rejected
```
Call: profiles_save (filename: "_internal_thing", title: "Internal Thing", confirmed: true)
Expect: error containing "cannot start with underscore"
Note: leading-underscore filenames are reserved for internal files (e.g. _current.json).
      ProfileStorage::listProfiles filters them out, so a save would silently disappear
      from profiles_list. Caught upfront with a clear error per #1006.
```

### 4.10 profiles_delete — user profile (must switch active first)
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "default", confirmed: true)   # leave mcp_test_tmp
Call: profiles_delete (filename: "mcp_test_tmp", confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true, message contains "deleted"
Verify: profiles_list → no profile with filename "mcp_test_tmp"
Note: deleting the currently-active profile is rejected with an actionable error
      ("Cannot delete the currently-active profile '<name>'. Call profiles_set_active
      with a different profile first, then retry.") — always switch active to a
      different profile before delete (#983, PR #984).
```

### 4.11 profiles_delete — built-in revert
```
Call: profiles_delete (filename: "default", confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true, "reverted":true (or "deleted":true if a user override existed)
Verify: profiles_set_active (filename: "default", confirmed: true) → success (built-in still exists)
Note: succeeds even when no user override exists — reports "reverted" no-op.
```

### 4.12 profiles_set_active — built-in profile
```
Call: profiles_set_active (filename: "blooming_espresso", confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true
Verify: profiles_get_active → title="Blooming Espresso"
```

### 4.13 profiles_create — all editor types
```
For each type in [dflow, aflow, pressure, flow, advanced]:
  Call: profiles_create (editorType: type, title: "_MCP Test " + type, confirmed: true)
  Expect: success=true, editorType=type, filename="" (in-memory only — not yet saved)
  Verify: profiles_get_params → editorType matches type
  Cleanup: profiles_set_active (filename: "default", confirmed: true)  # discards unsaved
```
Note: `profiles_create` only creates the profile in memory — call `profiles_save` with
filename/title to persist. Switching active profile discards the unsaved draft.

### 4.14 Verify removed tool — dialing_apply_change
```
Call: dialing_apply_change (grinderSetting: "12", confirmed: true)
Expect: error — tool not found (removed in phase 15)
```

## 5. Settings

### 5.1 settings_get
```
Call: settings_get
Expect: espressoTemperatureC, targetWeightG, steamTemperatureC, waterTemperatureC, dyeBeanBrand all present
Save: note dyeBeanBrand as ORIGINAL_BRAND, dyeGrinderSetting as ORIGINAL_GRIND
```
Note: read fields are unit/scale-suffixed (`espressoTemperatureC`, `targetWeightG`),
write fields drop the suffix (`espressoTemperature`, `targetWeight`). The `keys`
filter on `settings_get` accepts both forms — passing the suffixed read name an
LLM saw in a previous response round-trips correctly.

### 5.1a settings_get — keys filter round-trip
```
Call: settings_get (keys: ["espressoTemperatureC", "targetWeightG"])
Expect: both fields present in response (suffixed alias accepted).
Call: settings_get (keys: ["espressoTemperature"])
Expect: response contains espressoTemperatureC (un-suffixed write name still works).
```

### 5.1b settings_get — unknown category / keys reject
```
Call: settings_get (category: "preferences")
Expect: error="Unknown category 'preferences'", validCategories array present.
Call: settings_get (keys: ["nonexistentKey"])
Expect: error="Unknown settings key(s)", unknownKeys=["nonexistentKey"].
Call: settings_get (keys: ["dyeBeanBrand", "typoo"])
Expect: error, unknownKeys=["typoo"] (mixed valid+invalid is still an error).
```

### 5.2 settings_set — DYE metadata
```
Call: settings_set (dyeBeanBrand: "MCP Test Brand", dyeGrinderSetting: "99", confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true, updated includes "dyeBeanBrand" and "dyeGrinderSetting"
```

### 5.2a settings_set — unknown key reject
```
Call: settings_set (nonexistentKey: 42, confirmed: true)
Expect: error="Unknown settings key(s)", unknownKeys=["nonexistentKey"]. No setters fire.
```

### 5.3 Cleanup: restore DYE
```
Call: settings_set (dyeBeanBrand: ORIGINAL_BRAND, dyeGrinderSetting: ORIGINAL_GRIND, confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true
```

## 6. Shot History

### 6.1 shots_list
```
Call: shots_list (limit: 3)
Expect: count=3, each shot has id, profileName, durationSec, enjoyment0to100,
        doseG, yieldG, targetWeightG, timestamp (ISO 8601).
        Top-level fields: total, offset=0, hasMore=true (if total > 3),
        nextOffset=3 (or null when hasMore=false).
Save: note first shot id as SHOT_ID, second shot id as SHOT_ID_2
```
Note: list summaries use unit/scale-suffixed field names (`durationSec`, `doseG`,
`yieldG`, `enjoyment0to100`) per PR #976. Detail/compare responses now also use
suffixed names (`enjoyment0to100`, `drinkTdsPct`, `drinkEyPct`, `doseWeightG`,
`finalWeightG`) per PR #984 (#980).

### 6.2 shots_list — filtered
```
Call: shots_list (profileName: "D-Flow", limit: 3)
Expect: count > 0, all returned shots have profileName containing "D-Flow"
```

### 6.2a shots_list — feedback filters (#1011)
```
Call: shots_list (hasRating: true, limit: 5)
Expect: every returned shot has enjoyment0to100 != null (and > 0).
Call: shots_list (hasNotes: true, limit: 5)
Expect: every returned shot has non-empty `notes`.
Call: shots_list (hasTds: true, limit: 5)
Expect: every returned shot has drinkTdsPct > 0 (verify by spot-checking via shots_get_detail).
Call: shots_list (hasRating: true, hasNotes: true, beanBrand: "<known brand>", limit: 5)
Expect: filters compose; total / hasMore / nextOffset reflect the filtered subset.
```

### 6.3 shots_get_detail — summary (default)
```
Call: shots_get_detail (shotId: SHOT_ID)
Expect: id=SHOT_ID, scalars + phaseSummaries + summaryLines + detectorResults present.
        Time-series arrays (pressure, flow, temperature, etc.), debugLog, and
        profileJson are OMITTED in summary mode. Per-detector `gates` blocks
        (implementation thresholds) are OMITTED in both summary and full mode.
        detectorResults uses a uniform envelope shape (per #1012): every detector
        is its own object — `grind`, `channeling`, `flowTrend`, `tempStability`,
        `preinfusion`, plus `pour { truncated, startSec, endSec, peakPressureBar }`,
        `skipFirstFrame { detected }`, `verdict { category }`. The old top-level
        scalars (`pourTruncated`, `pourStartSec`, `pourEndSec`, `peakPressureBar`,
        `verdictCategory`) no longer appear; `skipFirstFrame` is now an object
        rather than a bool. `pour.peakPressureBar` is `null` when not truncated.
        Payload ~3 KB.
```

### 6.3a shots_get_detail — full
```
Call: shots_get_detail (shotId: SHOT_ID, detail: "full")
Expect: pressure array non-empty, flow array non-empty, temperature array non-empty,
        debugLog and profileJson included. Payload ~85 KB.
```
Note: PR #984 (#979) added the `detail: "summary" | "full"` param. `summary` is the
default — use `full` only when curve-aware analysis is needed.

### 6.4 shots_compare — summary (default)
```
Call: shots_compare (shotIds: [SHOT_ID, SHOT_ID_2])
Expect: response contains data for both shot IDs, plus a `changes` block diffing
        consecutive shots (durationSec, grinderSetting, doseG/yieldG, enjoyment0to100).
        ~3 KB per shot — no time-series, no debugLog, no profileJson.
        If both shots share the same profile: top-level `sharedProfile` block
        carries profileName/profileKbId/profileNotes once, and those fields are
        omitted from each shot. When shots span multiple profiles, the per-shot
        fields remain.
```

### 6.4a shots_compare — full
```
Call: shots_compare (shotIds: [SHOT_ID, SHOT_ID_2], detail: "full")
Expect: per-shot full payloads including time-series. ~85 KB per shot — exceeds
        typical LLM context with more than 1-2 shots.
```

### 6.5 shots_update — enjoyment and notes
```
Call: shots_get_detail (shotId: SHOT_ID)
Save: ORIGINAL_ENJOYMENT = enjoyment0to100, ORIGINAL_NOTES = espressoNotes
Call: shots_update (shotId: SHOT_ID, enjoyment: 85, notes: "MCP test run")
Expect: success=true, message contains shot ID, updated includes "enjoyment" and "espressoNotes"
Verify: shots_get_detail → enjoyment0to100=85, espressoNotes="MCP test run"
Cleanup: shots_update (shotId: SHOT_ID, enjoyment: ORIGINAL_ENJOYMENT, notes: ORIGINAL_NOTES)
```
Note: `shots_update` writers use un-suffixed names (`enjoyment`, `notes`); detail
reads return suffixed names (`enjoyment0to100`, `espressoNotes`).

### 6.6 shots_update — full metadata
```
Call: shots_get_detail (shotId: SHOT_ID)
Save: ORIGINAL_DOSE = doseWeightG, ORIGINAL_BARISTA = barista
Call: shots_update (shotId: SHOT_ID, doseWeight: 18.5, barista: "MCP Test")
Expect: success=true, updated includes "doseWeight" and "barista"
Verify: shots_get_detail (shotId: SHOT_ID) → doseWeightG=18.5
Cleanup: shots_update (shotId: SHOT_ID, doseWeight: ORIGINAL_DOSE, barista: ORIGINAL_BARISTA)
```
Note: `shots_update` writers use un-suffixed names (`doseWeight`, `drinkWeight`),
detail readers return suffixed names (`doseWeightG`, `finalWeightG`).

### 6.7 shots_delete — invalid ID (safe test)
```
Call: shots_delete (shotId: 999999, confirmed: true)
Expect: success=true (deletion queued — async, may not error on invalid ID)
Note: do NOT delete real shots in automated tests
```

### 6.8 Verify removed tool — shots_set_feedback
```
Call: shots_set_feedback (shotId: SHOT_ID, enjoyment: 85)
Expect: error — tool not found (replaced by shots_update in phase 15)
```

## 7. Dial-In

### 7.1 dialing_get_context
```
Call: dialing_get_context (history_limit: 5)
Expect: shotId > 0, shot object present, currentBean present, currentProfile present.
        profileKnowledge non-empty (if the profile has a KB entry) — small (~1 KB):
        only the current profile's curated section. No system prompt / reference
        tables / cross-profile catalog (per #987).
        dialInSessions present when prior shots exist on the same profile —
        an array of session objects { sessionStart, sessionEnd, shotCount, shots[] }.
        Sessions are emitted newest-first; shots within a session are oldest-first.
        Each shot after the first in a session carries `changeFromPrev` (a diff
        in the same shape shots_compare emits: grinderSetting, doseG, yieldG,
        durationSec, enjoyment0to100, beanBrand). Shots within ~60 minutes of
        each other on the same profile are grouped into one session (per #1009).
        tastingFeedback block present with hasEnjoymentScore / hasNotes /
        hasRefractometer booleans. When all three are true, `recommendation` is
        omitted; when any is false, `recommendation` carries an instruction to
        ask the user how the shot tasted before suggesting changes (per #1010).
```

### 7.1a dialing_get_context — full knowledge
```
Call: dialing_get_context (history_limit: 2, includeFullKnowledge: true)
Expect: profileKnowledge ~18 KB — includes the dial-in system prompt, espresso
        reference tables, profile catalog, and the current profile's section.
        Use this on the first turn of a dial-in conversation; subsequent turns can
        rely on the default (small) form.
```

### 7.2 settings_set — DYE metadata (replaces dialing_apply_change)
```
Call: settings_set (dyeGrinderSetting: "99", confirmed: true)
Expect: updated includes "dyeGrinderSetting"
Cleanup: settings_set (dyeGrinderSetting: ORIGINAL_GRIND, confirmed: true)
```

## 8. Scale

### 8.1 scale_get_weight
```
Call: scale_get_weight
Expect: weight is number, flowRate is number
```

### 8.2 scale_tare
```
Call: scale_tare
Expect: success=true
```

### 8.3 scale_timer — start, stop, reset
```
Call: scale_timer_start
Expect: success=true
Call: scale_timer_stop
Expect: success=true
Call: scale_timer_reset
Expect: success=true
```

## 9. Devices

### 9.1 devices_list
```
Call: devices_list
Expect: devices is array (may be empty in simulator), count is number
```

### 9.2 devices_connection_status
```
Call: devices_connection_status
Expect: machineConnected is boolean, bleAvailable is boolean
```

### 9.3 devices_scan
```
Call: devices_scan
Expect: success=true
```

## 10. Debug

### 10.1 debug_get_log
```
Call: debug_get_log (offset: 0, limit: 10)
Expect: totalLines > 0, returnedLines <= 10, hasMore=true (if totalLines > 10)
```

## Cleanup (restore system to original state)

```
Step 1 — Restore active profile:
  Call: profiles_set_active (filename: ORIGINAL_PROFILE, confirmed: true)
  Verify: profiles_get_active → filename = ORIGINAL_PROFILE

Step 2 — Restore DYE metadata:
  Call: settings_set (dyeBeanBrand: ORIGINAL_BRAND, dyeBeanType: ORIGINAL_BEAN_TYPE,
                      dyeRoastLevel: ORIGINAL_ROAST, dyeGrinderSetting: ORIGINAL_GRIND,
                      confirmed: true)

Step 3 — Restore machine phase (if was sleeping):
  If ORIGINAL_PHASE was "Sleep":
    Call: machine_sleep (confirmed: true)

Step 4 — Verify clean state:
  Call: profiles_get_active → filename = ORIGINAL_PROFILE, modified = false
  Call: settings_get → dyeBeanBrand = ORIGINAL_BRAND, dyeGrinderSetting = ORIGINAL_GRIND
  Call: machine_get_state → phase matches ORIGINAL_PHASE (or Ready if was Ready)
```

### What this test plan does NOT leave behind
- No temporary profiles on disk (`mcp_test_tmp` deleted in 4.10, `default` override reverted in 4.11)
- No modified DYE metadata (restored in cleanup step 2)
- No modified grinder setting (restored in 7.3 cleanup and cleanup step 2)
- No permanently altered shot feedback (restored in 6.5 cleanup)
- No changed machine phase (restored in cleanup step 3)
- Active profile and temperature restored to pre-test values

## 11. Settings Parity (Phase 16)

Valid categories per the `settings_get` schema:
`machine, calibration, connections, screensaver, accessibility, ai, espresso, steam,
water, flush, dye, mqtt, themes, visualizer, update, data, history, language, debug,
battery, heater, autofavorites`. There is **no** `preferences` category — what used
to live there has been split. Most landed in `machine` (sleep, theme, brightness,
auto-wake, refill kit, post-shot review, default rating, …) but not all: tick/TTS
moved to `accessibility`, screensaver-only keys to `screensaver`, update-channel
keys to `update`, language to `language`. Use the table below to find a key's home,
or pass `keys:["…"]` to bypass categories entirely.

### State Capture
```
Call: settings_get (category: "machine")
Save: ORIGINAL_AUTO_SLEEP = autoSleepMinutes, ORIGINAL_KEEP_STEAM = keepSteamHeaterOn,
      ORIGINAL_THEME_MODE = themeMode

Verify: settings_get does NOT return openaiApiKey, anthropicApiKey, mqttPassword,
        visualizerUsername, visualizerPassword, mcpApiKey
Note: These fields are not in settings_set schema — attempts to set them are silently ignored
```

### 11.12 settings_set — language
```
Call: settings_get (category: "language")
Save: ORIGINAL_LANG = currentLanguage
Call: settings_set (currentLanguage: "de", confirmed: true)

## Field-name reference (PR #976 / #975)

Settings, profile, and shot responses use unit/scale-suffixed reader names but
un-suffixed writer names. Quick lookup:

| Concept | Read field (responses) | Write field (settings_set / shots_update) |
|---|---|---|
| Espresso temp | `espressoTemperatureC` | `espressoTemperature` |
| Steam temp | `steamTemperatureC` | `steamTemperature` |
| Water temp | `waterTemperatureC` | `waterTemperature` |
| Profile target temp | `targetTemperatureC` | (via `tempStart`/`espresso_temperature` on `profiles_edit_params`) |
| Target weight | `targetWeightG` | `targetWeight` |
| Shot duration | `durationSec` | n/a (computed) |
| Shot enjoyment | `enjoyment0to100` | `enjoyment` (`shots_update`) |
| Shot TDS | `drinkTdsPct` | `drinkTds` (`shots_update`) |
| Shot EY | `drinkEyPct` | `drinkEy` (`shots_update`) |
| Shot dose | `doseG` (list) / `doseWeightG` (detail) | `doseWeight` (`shots_update`) |
| Shot yield | `yieldG` (list) / `finalWeightG` (detail) | `drinkWeight` (`shots_update`) |
| Shot notes | `notes` (list) / `espressoNotes` (detail) | `notes` (`shots_update`) |

PR #984 (#980) extended the suffixed-read convention through `ShotProjection`, so
`shots_get_detail` and `shots_compare` now match `shots_list` for `enjoyment0to100`,
`drinkTdsPct`, and `drinkEyPct`. Per #991, all three fields are emitted as `null`
(not `0`) on shots that lack a rating or refractometer measurement, so callers can
distinguish unrated/unmeasured from a deliberate zero. Remaining read/write asymmetries (dose, yield, notes)
are tracked separately — read names use the projection's full member name (`doseWeightG`,
`finalWeightG`, `espressoNotes`) while write names use the legacy short form for
`shots_update`/`settings_set` schemas.

Open follow-ups for the remaining inconsistencies:
- `profiles_get_active` vs `profiles_get_params` naming (#992)
- `keys: [...]` filter on `settings_get` rejects suffixed read names (#985)
