/**
 * Relaunches Decenza after a self-update.
 *
 * On ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED, builds the launch intent for this package,
 * tags it with EXTRA_AUTO_RELAUNCH, and calls startActivity().
 *
 * Modern Android (10+) blocks startActivity() from a BroadcastReceiver unless
 * the process holds a BAL exemption. The exemption we rely on here is
 * SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW ("Display over other apps") which is declared in the
 * manifest and must be granted by the user. If permission is not granted,
 * startActivity() silently fails (BAL rejection) and the user re-opens the
 * app manually — same as before this code existed.
 *
 * Diagnostic flag file: writes a short line to AppDataLocation/auto_relaunch_fired.txt
 * on every receiver invocation so the next app launch can confirm "yes the
 * receiver did fire" even if BAL blocked the activity start. UpdateChecker
 * reads and clears this file on startup.
 *
 * Prior empirical work (commits 0db30f00 / 208655c8 / 5e19c785, 2026-04-19)
 * established that:
 *   - the plain MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED → startActivity() path is BAL-blocked on
 *     Samsung Android 16 (logcat result code=102);
 *   - PendingIntent with full creator/sender BAL opt-in is also blocked;
 *   - a notification fallback works mechanically but Samsung One UI suppresses
 *     its visibility to a badge count, defeating the UX goal.
 *
 * This implementation is the one path not exhausted by that work: declare
 * SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW so the receiver's process holds BAL exemption #13
 * directly (per the Android BAL exemption list), without trying to delegate
 * privilege through a PendingIntent across processes.
 *
 * Also provides {@link #launchSawPermissionSettings(Activity)} as a static
 * utility called via JNI from C++ to open Android Settings deeplinked to
 * this app's SAW page. This lives here (rather than on a separate helper
 * class) because it's part of the same auto-relaunch story.

     * presently triggered by the "Open Settings" button in the one-time
     * post-update prompt, but the method is general.
     *
     * Implemented on the Java side rather than reaching into Java from C++
     * because the prior C++ approach (Uri.fromParts via JNI variadic call
     * with three jstring args) produced a URI with empty SSP — root cause
     * appears to be a Qt 6.10 variadic-JNI marshalling issue with multiple
     * jstring args (symptom-confirmed: empty SSP; no minimal repro of the
     * marshalling bug itself). Doing everything in Java means we only have
     * to JNI-call this single static method with one jobject argument,
     * which Qt handles reliably.
     *
     * Threading: invoked from the Qt main thread (not the Android UI
     * thread). Activity-instance accessors used here ({@code getPackageName},
     * {@code startActivity}) are documented as thread-safe; the call site
     * matches the pattern already used by {@code ApkInstaller} elsewhere
     * in this package.
     *
     * Behaviour: if {@code activity} is null, a warning is logged and no
     * Intent is started. Any exception thrown by Settings (e.g. on an
     * OEM ROM that has stripped MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION) is caught and
     * logged; the caller has no way to detect the failure other than
     * observing that the user never grants the permission.
