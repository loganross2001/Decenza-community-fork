## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Active bag selection
The system SHALL maintain a single global `activeBagId` in `SettingsDye` (replacing the `bean/selectedPreset` index). The active bag's fields drive the next shot's bean snapshot.

Applying a bag's **yield spec** SHALL be gated on **no recipe being active**: the resolution ladder of `yield-anchor` (recipe → bag → profile) SHALL be enforced explicitly, never left to emerge from the order in which the bag-selection and recipe-activation signals happen to arrive. **Applying a bag's dose SHALL be gated the same way**, per the ladder in `dose-source-precedence`. The two were previously asymmetric — the yield spec respected the ladder while the dose applied unconditionally, so selecting a bag replaced an active recipe's dose while leaving its yield alone. Nothing about the bag justified the difference; the dose simply had no ladder to obey.

#### Scenario: Bag selection applies all fields
- **WHEN** the user selects a bag (from inventory or Change Beans dialog)
- **THEN** all bag fields SHALL become the active state for the next shot

#### Scenario: Bag selection applies dose and yield spec to the machine
- **WHEN** a bag with a stored `doseWeightG` and a yield spec whose mode is not `none` is selected, and no recipe is active
- **THEN** the dose SHALL drive the next shot's dose (`dyeBeanWeight`)
- **AND** switching the bean SHALL first reset the brew overrides to the active profile's defaults, then re-apply the bag's yield spec to the session anchor — so the next shot's target is the bean's own, and a bag without an anchor stays at the profile default
- **AND** the bag's yield spec is NOT routed through `dyeDrinkWeight` (which remains plain DYE drink-weight metadata)

#### Scenario: Recipe-driven bag selection does not overwrite the recipe's dose
- **WHEN** a bag with a stored `doseWeightG` is selected while a recipe supplying a dose is active
- **THEN** the next shot's dose SHALL remain the recipe's
- **AND** the bag's dose SHALL NOT be written to `dyeBeanWeight`

#### Scenario: A bag's own anchor is a baseline, not an override
- **WHEN** a bag holding `{42.0, absolute}` is active, no recipe is active, and the profile's `target_weight` is 36 g
- **THEN** every surface SHALL render 42 g as the BASELINE — un-highlighted, with no `36.0 → 42.0g` arrow on the Shot Plan — because the bean's yield is its design, not a deviation from the profile (the `yield-anchor` ladder resolves the baseline; a bag's anchor is button-protected and therefore always deliberate)
- **AND** only a per-brew deviation FROM 42 g SHALL highlight, arrowing against the bean's 42 g rather than the profile's 36 g
- **AND** pressing "Update Bag" on a deviation SHALL make the shown value the bean's stored spec, clearing the highlight on every surface

#### Scenario: Recipe-driven bag selection does not overwrite the recipe's anchor
- **WHEN** a recipe holding `{2.0, ratio}` is activated and activation selects the recipe's own linked bag, which holds `{40.0, absolute}`
- **THEN** the session anchor is `{2.0, ratio}`
- **AND** the bag's yield spec is not applied

#### Scenario: A manual bean switch still hands the brew to the bag
- **WHEN** a recipe is active and the user manually changes the active bean
- **THEN** the recipe deactivates (`recipe-activation`), so no recipe is active and the newly selected bag's yield spec applies normally

#### Scenario: New bag with no dose or yield spec yet
- **WHEN** a bag with a null/0 `doseWeightG` and a yield mode of `none` is selected
- **THEN** the current global dose SHALL remain in effect and the brew yield SHALL follow the profile default
- **AND** the bag SHALL adopt the dose on the first edit or shot save, and its yield spec only when the user presses "Update Bag" in brew settings

#### Scenario: A bag's dose is not known until its row arrives
- **WHEN** a bag is selected and a profile carrying a recommended dose is loaded before that bag's row has been read
- **THEN** the profile's dose SHALL NOT be applied
- **AND** the bag's stored `doseWeightG` SHALL be unchanged

The row load is asynchronous, so between the selection and its arrival the bag is indistinguishable
from one holding no dose. Reading it as empty would let the profile's dose through — and because
that write travels back to the bag, it would replace the dose the bean actually remembered
(`dose-source-precedence`).

#### Scenario: No active bag
- **WHEN** no bag is selected (`activeBagId` is null or references a deleted bag)
- **THEN** the bean summary SHALL display "No beans selected" and prompt the user to select a bag
