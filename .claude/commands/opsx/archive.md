Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name after `/opsx:archive` (e.g., `/opsx:archive add-auth`). If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check readiness**

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` to check artifact completion, and read the tasks file to count incomplete tasks (`- [ ]` vs `- [x]`).

   **If any artifacts are not `done`, or incomplete tasks exist:**
   - Display a warning listing what's incomplete
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm the user wants to proceed
   - Stop if the user declines

3. **Archive via the openspec CLI**

   Run the standard tool — do NOT reimplement archiving by hand (no manual `mkdir`/`mv`, no manually diffing delta specs against main specs, no spawning an agent to "sync specs"). `openspec archive` does all of that natively in one step: it validates, applies delta specs to `openspec/specs/`, and moves the change directory to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`.

   ```bash
   openspec archive "<name>" --yes
   ```

   - Add `--skip-specs` only if the change has no delta specs (infra/tooling/doc-only changes).
   - `--yes` skips the CLI's own interactive confirmation — safe here because step 2 already secured the user's confirmation for anything incomplete.
   - If the command reports the target archive directory already exists, stop and surface the conflict to the user (rename the existing archive, delete it if it's a duplicate, or wait for a different date) — do not resolve this by hand.

4. **Report the result**

   Relay the CLI's own output (which specs it created/updated and the totals, plus the final archived-to path) as the summary. Don't restate or re-derive it manually.

**Output**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** <relay whatever `openspec archive` reported — updated/created capabilities, or "no specs to update">

<Note any warnings surfaced in step 2, e.g. "Archived with N incomplete tasks (user confirmed)".>
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use `openspec status --change --json` for the readiness check — don't hand-parse or diff delta specs yourself
- Don't block archive on warnings once the user has confirmed — just inform and proceed
- `openspec archive` is the only thing that touches `openspec/changes/` or `openspec/specs/` — never `mkdir`, `mv`, or hand-edit those paths, and never invoke a "sync specs" skill or agent (no such skill exists in this project)
