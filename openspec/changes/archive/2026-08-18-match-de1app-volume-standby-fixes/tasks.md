## 1. Stop-at-Volume: forced-rise frames excluded from pour volume

- [x] 1.1 Confirm forced-rise-without-limit frame exit-condition semantics (`BLE_PROTOCOL.md` /
      firmware behavior) to decide between design.md's option (a) (`exitIf==true` on the
      forced-rise frame) and option (b) (separate preinfusion-count increment). Confirmed via
      `ProfileFrame::computeFlags()` (`profileframe.cpp:571-574`): `exitIf` drives the real
      DE1 `DoCompare` flag byte, so option (a) would change on-machine exit behavior. Used
      option (b).
- [x] 1.2 Fix a Pressure-type profile's preinfusion frame count to include each "forced rise
      without limit" frame, without touching frame `exitIf`. Added shared helper
      `Profile::countPreinfuseFramesWithForcedRise()` and applied it at all four sites that
      independently compute this count: `RecipeGenerator::createProfile()`,
      `Profile::regenerateSimpleFrames()`, `Profile::regenerateFromRecipe()`, and
      `Profile::loadFromTclString()` (the de1app `.tcl` import path — the actual bug-report
      scenario). Originally scoped to just the first site; expanded once the other three
      turned out to share the same bug independently.
- [x] 1.3 Verify `MachineState::onFlowSample()` routes forced-rise-frame flow into
      `m_preinfusionVolume` (not `m_pourVolume`) once the frame count is corrected — no code
      change expected here, confirm behavior only. Confirmed: `m_phase` (`machinestate.cpp:387`)
      is derived from the DE1 firmware's own SubState, which the firmware computes by comparing
      the live frame index against `NumberOfPreinfuseFrames` — the header byte this fix corrects.
      No client-side routing change needed.
- [x] 1.4 Added unit tests: `tests/tst_recipegenerator.cpp`
      (`pressureProfileCountsForcedRiseAsPreinfusion`, `pressureProfileCountsBothForcedRiseFrames`,
      `flowProfilePreinfuseCountUnaffectedByForcedRiseFix`) for the Recipe Editor path, and
      `tests/tst_profile.cpp` (assertions added to `pressureProfileFrameGeneration`,
      `pressureProfileShortHold`, `tempSteppingPressure`) for the JSON/`.tcl`-import
      materialization path.
- [x] 1.5 `tests/data/shots/` (recorded shot samples) had no match — unrelated to profile
      generation. But the actual test run (see 5.1) surfaced two STATIC fixture sets that
      genuinely needed updating, since they snapshot de1app's/Decenza's PRE-fix output:
      - `tests/data/de1app_packed/*.txt` — 17 goldens regenerated via
        `python3 tools/gen_de1app_pack_corpus.py <de1app-checkout>/de1plus` against the local
        de1app checkout (already at the fixing commit `13a30463`), which runs de1app's REAL
        `pressure_to_advanced_list` live — so these now reflect de1app's actual fixed behavior,
        not a hand-edited guess.
      - `resources/profiles/*.json` (17 shipped built-ins) — `number_of_preinfuse_frames` /
        `target_volume_count_start` were stored as static fields and stale. `profile_sync`'s own
        `--sync` comparator couldn't catch or fix this: `normaliseSimpleProfile()`
        (`tools/profile_sync.cpp`) recomputed `preinfuseFrameCount` fresh on BOTH sides before
        comparing (needed to materialize empty-`steps` built-ins for the frame diff, but it
        clobbered the field being compared as a side effect), so the two sides always agreed
        with themselves regardless of what was actually stored — compare mode read "0 different"
        against the true drift. Fixed `normaliseSimpleProfile()` to keep the JSON side's ORIGINAL
        stored count after materializing its frames, so the comparison is against what's really
        on disk. Verified: reverted the 17 files to their stale committed values, ran
        `profile_sync --sync`, and it correctly re-derived and rewrote the exact same 17 files —
        confirmed byte-for-byte against the original hand-patch, plus a deliberate-corruption
        test proving the comparator now flags a real mismatch. Full suite re-run clean after.
      - Also fixed one stale hardcoded expectation in `tst_profile.cpp`
        (`tempSteppingEmitsBoostFrameEvenAtZeroPreinfusion`, was asserting the old un-fixed count).

## 2. Standby-switch (Error_NoAC) detection

- [x] 2.1 Add `Error_NoAC` (217) to `DE1::SubState` (`src/ble/protocol/de1characteristics.h`).
- [x] 2.2 Reset `m_subState` in `DE1Device::onTransportDisconnected()`
      (`src/ble/de1device.cpp`) so a stale `Error_NoAC` cannot persist across a BLE drop.
- [x] 2.3 Added `MachineState.standbySwitchOpen` (bool property + `standbySwitchOpenChanged`
      signal, `machinestate.h`/`.cpp`), computed in `updatePhase()` from `Error_NoAC` +
      `firmwareBuildNumber() >= 1337`, forced false in the disconnected branch.

## 3. Standby-switch warning UI

- [x] 3.1 Added `standbySwitchDialog` (`qml/main.qml`), a `DecenzaDialog` sized to
      `Overlay.overlay` width/height (true full-screen, following the refill-dialog pattern but
      edge-to-edge rather than a centered card), driven by `MachineState.standbySwitchOpen`.
      Text goes through `Tr` (`main.dialog.standbySwitch.message`, fallback "Push the switch
      on"), matching every other dialog in the file — no hardcoded string.
- [x] 3.2 `AccessibleMouseArea` covers the full dialog content; `onAccessibleClicked` calls
      `standbySwitchDialog.close()`. Dismissal reveals the page underneath automatically (modal
      Popup over the StackView) — no manual return-page tracking, matching design.md.
- [x] 3.3 `Connections { target: MachineState; function onStandbySwitchOpenChanged() }` opens on
      the true transition and closes when it goes false (condition cleared or DE1 disconnected —
      `MachineState.standbySwitchOpen` is forced false in both). Reacting only to the CHANGE
      (not "still true") means a tap-dismiss isn't immediately reopened by the same occurrence,
      but a fresh false→true transition (the condition recurring) opens it again. Also wired
      into the screensaver popup-queue (`standbySwitch` id) alongside `refillDialog`.
- [x] 3.4 Verified structurally: `standbySwitchDialog` is a `DecenzaDialog`/`T.Dialog` declared
      as a direct sibling of `refillDialog` at `main.qml`'s root level, not nested in any page.
      Qt Quick Controls renders every `Popup`/`Dialog` through `Overlay.overlay`, not as a child
      of its QML parent in the StackView hierarchy — the same mechanism that already makes
      `refillDialog` appear over every page in production. Its visibility is driven solely by
      `MachineState.standbySwitchOpenChanged`, with no page-specific gating anywhere. I can't
      launch the app myself to click through idle/brew/settings on-device — that on-device pass
      is still for Jeff.

## 4. Manual testing

- [x] 4.1 Verified on the Decenza macOS sim (`best_overall_pressure_profile`, holdTime 10s,
      targetVolume 40mL, weight-stop and scale both disabled so SAV alone gates the stop —
      `checkStopAtVolume()` skips SAV outright for basic profiles when a scale is configured,
      matching de1app; unrelated to this fix, just had to disable it for a clean test).
      `stoppedBy: "volume"`, duration 14.808s = preinfusion (0.4s) + forced-rise (3.0s, excluded)
      + ~11.4s of actual pour at ~3.5mL/s ≈ 40mL. Off by ~4g/40 (~10%, matches the code's own
      "flow sensor is imprecise, no lag compensation" note), not the ~14/40 (35%) systematic
      shortfall the bug produced. Confirms the fix.
- [ ] 4.2 BLOCKED — Jeff's DE1 predates firmware 1337 / the standby switch this feature targets,
      so this can't be closed on available hardware. Verification ceiling for now: simulated
      substate injection (`tests/tst_machinestate.cpp` `standbySwitch*` tests,
      `tests/tst_de1device_headless.cpp` `disconnectResetsSubState`) plus the structural QML check
      in 3.4. Leave open; close only if hardware with the switch + firmware >= 1337 becomes
      available, or drop from the gate if the team decides code+test coverage is sufficient to
      ship without it.

## 5. Review and merge

- [x] 5.1 Ran the full local test suite via Qt Creator MCP (`run_tests`, scope `all`): 113/113
      pass, 0 failures. (First run surfaced 3 failing binaries from stale fixtures — see 1.5 —
      fixed, then re-ran clean.)
- [x] 5.2 Opened [PR #1835](https://github.com/Kulitorum/Decenza/pull/1835).
- [x] 5.3 Ran `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` (code-reviewer, pr-test-analyzer, comment-analyzer,
      silent-failure-hunter, in parallel). Fixed everything raised, several corroborated by 2-3
      agents independently:
      - **Critical**: `standbySwitchOpen`'s firmware gate evaluated before `firmwareBuildNumber()`
        was populated (arrives later via MMR read), with nothing re-triggering `updatePhase()`
        when it lands — a machine already in `Error_NoAC` at connect never showed the warning for
        the whole session. Fixed by connecting `DE1Device::firmwareVersionChanged` to
        `MachineState::updatePhase` (`machinestate.cpp`). de1app hits the same gap and papers over
        it with a timer; this project's no-timers-as-guards rule made the signal-driven recheck
        the right port instead.
      - `Error_NoAC` had no case in `subStateToString()` → rendered "Unknown" in a user-visible
        layout widget and 4 network surfaces. Added the case (`de1characteristics.h`).
      - `standbySwitchDialog` was missing from `anyModalDialogVisible()`, so it could get stacked
        under `recipeActivationFailedDialog`. Added it (`main.qml`).
      - `"forced rise without limit"` was a load-bearing string duplicated across 5 sites with no
        compile-time link. Hoisted to `ProfileFrame::kForcedRiseWithoutLimitName`
        (`profileframe.h`), all 5 sites now reference it.
      - My own `profile_sync.cpp` fix from earlier in this change worked, but two agents
        independently proved the branch I'd added was dead code: real built-in JSONs never ship
        empty `steps`, so the actual fix is just removing the OLD unconditional overwrite. Deleted
        `normaliseSimpleProfile()` entirely and compare directly — re-verified with the same
        revert/`--sync`/corruption tests as before.
      - Added tests for the two real coverage gaps found (`regenerateFromRecipe()`'s forced-rise
        branch — the actual live profile-edit save path, previously zero coverage; and
        `MachineState.standbySwitchOpen` + the disconnect substate-reset, both zero coverage
        despite an existing harness making it cheap). The new `regenerateFromRecipe` test caught
        a real bug in itself on the first run — `Profile::editorType()` derives from
        title/profileType, not `m_recipeParams`, so the test's original settings_2c base profile
        made `regenerateFromRecipe()`'s own "advanced" early-return a silent no-op; fixed by
        basing it on settings_2a.
      - One pr-test-analyzer claim was wrong and not acted on: it said the simple-profile
        `de1app_packed` goldens are unread by any test — directly contradicted by watching
        `tst_recipeeditorparity::everyDe1appProfilePacksIdentically` fail then pass against
        exactly those fixtures earlier in this change.
      - Full suite re-run clean after every fix: 113/113.
- [x] 5.4 Merged via `/merge-pr`: [9821521](https://github.com/Kulitorum/Decenza/commit/98215217e1f60cdd77109cd3a6f4e62014fd84a5).
      Note: this archive step should have ridden as the final commit on PR #1835 before
      merging, per project convention — it was missed and PR #1835 was already merged when
      the archive was requested, so this archive instead lands as its own follow-up PR.
