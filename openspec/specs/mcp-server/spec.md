# mcp-server Specification

## Purpose
Decenza's MCP server: protocol version negotiation and the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header, `Origin` validation, structured tool output, resource-link content blocks, tool/resource titles and icons, and JSON Schema 2020-12 input schemas, plus the domain tool surface for scale connection-priority mode and diagnostics, equipment package (grinder/basket/puck-prep) reads and writes, and bag bean-detail fields.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Latest Protocol Version Support

The MCP server SHALL declare `2025-11-25` as its preferred protocol version and SHALL also accept `2025-06-18`, `2025-03-26`, and `2024-11-05` for backward compatibility. During `initialize`, the server SHALL respond with the client-requested version when it is in the supported set, otherwise SHALL respond with the preferred version.

#### Scenario: Client requests current version
- **WHEN** a client sends `initialize` with `protocolVersion: "2025-11-25"`
- **THEN** the server responds with `protocolVersion: "2025-11-25"`

#### Scenario: Client requests prior version
- **WHEN** a client sends `initialize` with `protocolVersion: "2025-03-26"`
- **THEN** the server responds with `protocolVersion: "2025-03-26"` and SHALL serve subsequent requests under that version

#### Scenario: Client requests unsupported version
- **WHEN** a client sends `initialize` with `protocolVersion: "2023-01-01"`
- **THEN** the server responds with `protocolVersion: "2025-11-25"` (its preferred version)

### Requirement: MCP-Protocol-Version Request Header

For every HTTP request other than `initialize`, the server SHALL accept the `MCP-Protocol-Version` request header. When present, the value MUST equal the version negotiated at `initialize` for the session; mismatches SHALL be rejected with HTTP 400. When absent, the server SHALL assume `2025-03-26` per the spec's compatibility rule.

#### Scenario: Header matches negotiated version
- **WHEN** a client POSTs `tools/call` with `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-25` after negotiating `2025-11-25`
- **THEN** the server processes the request normally

#### Scenario: Header mismatch
- **WHEN** a client POSTs `tools/call` with `MCP-Protocol-Version: 2024-11-05` after negotiating `2025-11-25`
- **THEN** the server returns HTTP 400 with body indicating protocol version mismatch

#### Scenario: Header absent on legacy client
- **WHEN** a client negotiates `2025-03-26` and POSTs subsequent requests without an `MCP-Protocol-Version` header
- **THEN** the server processes the request normally, assuming `2025-03-26`

### Requirement: Origin Header Validation

The server SHALL validate the `Origin` request header on every `/mcp` HTTP request before any JSON-RPC parsing. Empty or absent `Origin` SHALL be accepted. Non-empty `Origin` SHALL be matched against an allowlist that includes loopback addresses and the host's own LAN IP addresses; non-matching origins SHALL receive HTTP 403. CORS responses SHALL echo the validated origin back via `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` rather than wildcarding.

#### Scenario: Loopback browser request
- **WHEN** a browser at `http://localhost:3000` requests `/mcp` with `Origin: http://localhost:3000`
- **THEN** the server processes the request and responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000`

#### Scenario: LAN browser request
- **WHEN** a browser on the same LAN requests `/mcp` with `Origin: http://192.168.1.50:5173` and the server's listener IP is on `192.168.1.0/24`
- **THEN** the server processes the request and echoes the origin

#### Scenario: Foreign origin
- **WHEN** any client requests `/mcp` with `Origin: http://evil.example`
- **THEN** the server returns HTTP 403 without parsing the request body

#### Scenario: CLI client without Origin
- **WHEN** `mcp-remote` POSTs `/mcp` with no `Origin` header
- **THEN** the server processes the request normally

### Requirement: Structured Tool Output

Every successful `tools/call` response SHALL include a `structuredContent` field carrying the tool's result payload as a JSON object. The existing `content` array with text content blocks SHALL be retained for backward compatibility with clients negotiating `2025-03-26` or earlier.

#### Scenario: Tool returns structured payload
- **WHEN** a client calls a tool that returns a JSON payload
- **THEN** the response includes both `content[]` (with at least one text block) and `structuredContent` (the same payload as a JSON object)

#### Scenario: Legacy client receives identical text
- **WHEN** a client negotiating `2025-03-26` calls the same tool
- **THEN** the response still includes the text content block matching the pre-upgrade behavior

### Requirement: Resource Link Content Blocks

Tools that return data backed by an MCP resource SHALL emit a `resource_link` content block referencing the canonical resource URI in addition to any inline payload. List-style tools SHALL emit one `resource_link` per item.

#### Scenario: Shot detail tool emits link
- **WHEN** a client calls `shots_get_detail` for shot `abc123`
- **THEN** the response `content[]` includes a `{"type":"resource_link","uri":"decenza://shots/abc123","title":"Shot abc123",...}` block alongside the inline shot payload

#### Scenario: Profile list tool emits links
- **WHEN** a client calls `profiles_list`
- **THEN** the response `content[]` includes one `resource_link` per profile, each pointing to `decenza://profiles/{filename}`

#### Scenario: Machine state read emits link
- **WHEN** a client calls a machine-state read tool
- **THEN** the response includes a `resource_link` referencing `decenza://machine/state`

### Requirement: Title Field on Tools and Resources

Every tool record returned by `tools/list` and every resource record returned by `resources/list` SHALL include a non-empty `title` field providing a human-readable display name distinct from the programmatic `name`/`uri`.

#### Scenario: Tool listing includes titles
- **WHEN** a client calls `tools/list`
- **THEN** every tool record includes both `name` (programmatic ID) and `title` (human-readable label)

#### Scenario: Resource listing includes titles
- **WHEN** a client calls `resources/list`
- **THEN** every resource record includes both `uri` and `title`

### Requirement: Icons on Tools and Resources

Every tool record returned by `tools/list` and every resource record returned by `resources/list` SHALL include an `icons` array with at least one entry. Each icon entry SHALL contain `src` (a `data:image/svg+xml;base64,...` URI), `mimeType: "image/svg+xml"`, and a `sizes` field. Icon assignment SHALL be driven by tool category and resource kind.

#### Scenario: Tool list includes icons
- **WHEN** a client calls `tools/list`
- **THEN** every tool record includes an `icons` array with at least one SVG entry encoded as a `data:` URI

#### Scenario: Resource list includes icons
- **WHEN** a client calls `resources/list`
- **THEN** every resource record includes an `icons` array with at least one SVG entry

### Requirement: JSON Schema 2020-12 Tool Input Schemas

Every tool's `inputSchema` SHALL be a valid JSON Schema 2020-12 document and SHALL declare `"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`. Use of pre-2020-12 keywords (`definitions`, `dependencies` as a single keyword) is prohibited.

#### Scenario: Tool list schemas declare 2020-12 dialect
- **WHEN** a client calls `tools/list`
- **THEN** every `inputSchema` object includes `"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema"`

#### Scenario: Schemas validate under 2020-12
- **WHEN** every `inputSchema` is fed to a JSON Schema 2020-12 validator
- **THEN** all schemas pass validation

### Requirement: Set Scale Connection-Priority Mode Tool

The MCP server SHALL expose a `devices_set_scale_priority_mode` tool that sets the persistent backoff policy mode to `enforce` or `observe`. It MUST require an explicit confirmation argument before applying. The change is eventually-consistent: it MUST be queued onto the BLE-manager thread and the response MUST NOT assert the persist has completed; the HIGH-forcing effect of `observe` additionally only applies on the next scale (re)connect and does NOT tear down the current connection. The response MUST state this queued, eventually-consistent contract explicitly. An unrecognized mode value MUST be rejected without changing state.

#### Scenario: Set observe mode
- **WHEN** the tool is called with `mode: "observe"` and `confirmed: true`
- **THEN** the mode change is queued and, once applied on the BLE-manager thread, reads back as `observe`
- **AND** the response states the change was queued (not asserted-persisted) and that HIGH-forcing applies on the next scale reconnect (the current connection is not torn down)

#### Scenario: Set back to enforce
- **WHEN** the tool is called with `mode: "enforce"` and `confirmed: true`
- **THEN** the mode change is queued and, once applied, reads back as `enforce`
- **AND** the prior persisted latch (if any) is honored again on the next reconnect

#### Scenario: Missing confirmation
- **WHEN** the tool is called without `confirmed: true`
- **THEN** no state changes and the response indicates confirmation is required

#### Scenario: Invalid mode value
- **WHEN** the tool is called with a `mode` other than `enforce` or `observe`
- **THEN** the call is rejected and the persisted mode is unchanged

### Requirement: Connection Status Reports Mode And Observe Events

The `devices_connection_status` tool SHALL report the active `backoffMode` and a bounded list of recent observe events. Each observe event MUST carry an ISO-8601 timestamp with UTC offset, the trigger kind as a human-readable string, an event kind (`wouldBackoff` or `recovered`), and the relevant duration with units in the field name (`stallSec` / `gapSec`). The list MUST be bounded (most recent first) and MUST be empty when the mode has never been `observe`.

#### Scenario: Status includes mode
- **WHEN** `devices_connection_status` is called
- **THEN** the response includes `backoffMode` as `"enforce"` or `"observe"`

#### Scenario: Observe events surfaced
- **WHEN** the mode is `observe` and one or more would-back-off and/or recovery events have occurred
- **THEN** the response includes a bounded, most-recent-first list of those events
- **AND** each event has an ISO-8601-with-offset timestamp, a human-readable trigger kind, an event kind of `wouldBackoff` or `recovered`, and a unit-suffixed duration field

#### Scenario: No observe history
- **WHEN** the mode has never been `observe` this run
- **THEN** the recent-observe-events list is empty (and `backoffMode` reports the current mode)

### Requirement: Connection Status Reports Detection Epoch And Diagnostic Build Code

The `devices_connection_status` tool SHALL report the current detection epoch and, when the scale link is latched, the build code that last set the classification as a diagnostic field. The build code MUST be presented as diagnostic ("last classified by build N"), not as the gating mechanism. Field names MUST follow the project MCP data conventions (human-readable, no Unix timestamps; the existing ISO-8601-with-offset latch timestamp is unchanged).

#### Scenario: Epoch always reported
- **WHEN** `devices_connection_status` is called
- **THEN** the scale connection-priority block includes the current detection epoch

#### Scenario: Diagnostic build code on a latched link
- **WHEN** the scale link is latched (skip-HIGH)
- **THEN** the response includes the build code that last set the classification, labeled as diagnostic
- **AND** the response does not present the build code as the rehydration gate

#### Scenario: Reset tool unchanged
- **WHEN** `devices_reset_scale_priority` is called
- **THEN** it clears the latch as before (the in-session escape hatch is unchanged by epoch scoping)

### Requirement: MCP grinder reads SHALL resolve via the equipment package
MCP surfaces that report grinder identity — the `de1://dialing` resource (`mcpresources.cpp`), `dialing_get_context`, `dialing_get_grinder_calibration`, and `ai_advisor_invoke` — SHALL resolve grinder brand/model/burrs through the equipment package (the active bag's package for live snapshots; the resolved shot's `equipment_id` for shot-derived blocks). They SHALL additionally expose the package identity (`id`, display `name`, `rpmAdjustable`) and the `rpm` dial-in. All fields SHALL follow MCP data conventions (units in field names, `kind` as a string enum, ISO-8601 timestamps).

#### Scenario: Dialing resource reports the package
- **WHEN** the `de1://dialing` resource is read
- **THEN** the grinder block SHALL include the resolved brand/model/setting plus `rpm` and `rpmAdjustable`, sourced from the active bag's equipment package

### Requirement: equipment_list tool
The MCP server SHALL provide an `equipment_list` tool (modeled on `bag_list`) returning equipment packages: `id`, display `name`, grinder `brand`/`model`/`burrs`, `rpmAdjustable`, `inInventory`, and the last-used grind setting and `rpm`.

#### Scenario: Listing packages
- **WHEN** an agent calls `equipment_list`
- **THEN** it SHALL receive the inventory of equipment packages with the fields above

### Requirement: equipment_select tool
The MCP server SHALL provide an `equipment_select` tool (modeled on `bag_select`) that sets the active bag's equipment package by id (or clears it with 0). Selecting a package SHALL apply that package's last grind setting / rpm to the active bag per the dual-memory rule.

#### Scenario: Selecting a package
- **WHEN** an agent calls `equipment_select` with a valid package id
- **THEN** the active bag's `equipment_id` SHALL be set to that package
- **AND** the active bag's grind setting and rpm SHALL be set to the package's last-dial values

### Requirement: equipment_update tool
The MCP server SHALL provide an `equipment_update` tool (modeled on `bag_update`) that edits a package's grinder identity (brand/model/burrs) and SHALL support creating a package. On a brand/model change, `rpmCapable` SHALL re-derive from the registry. Edits use reference semantics (apply to all referencing bags/shots).

#### Scenario: Editing a package
- **WHEN** an agent calls `equipment_update` changing a package's grinder model
- **THEN** the package SHALL be updated, `rpmAdjustable` re-derived, and all referencing bags/shots SHALL resolve to the new identity

### Requirement: Equipment MCP tools SHALL read and write the basket identity
The MCP `equipment_*` tools SHALL include the package's basket identity
(`brand`, `model`) in equipment reads, and SHALL accept an optional basket identity
when creating or updating a package, alongside the grinder identity. Omitting the
basket SHALL leave a package grinder-only. Basket edits SHALL flow through the same
package-identity (dedup/fork) rules as grinder edits.

#### Scenario: Equipment read includes the basket
- **WHEN** an MCP equipment read resolves a package that has a basket
- **THEN** the response SHALL include the basket brand and model

#### Scenario: Equipment write sets a basket
- **WHEN** an MCP equipment write supplies a basket identity
- **THEN** the package SHALL gain a `kind="basket"` item subject to the identity rules

### Requirement: MCP basket fields SHALL follow the data conventions
Basket fields exposed over MCP SHALL follow the project MCP conventions: dose range
named with its unit (`doseRangeG`), and `wallProfile` / `relativeFlow` / `precision`
expressed as human-readable strings/booleans rather than numeric codes. Derived
specs SHALL be omitted when unknown (custom basket) rather than zero-filled.

#### Scenario: Basket specs are LLM-legible
- **WHEN** the MCP dialing context emits the basket sub-object
- **THEN** `wallProfile` and `relativeFlow` SHALL be readable strings and the dose range SHALL be unit-suffixed (`doseRangeG`)

### Requirement: Equipment MCP tools SHALL read and write the puck-prep flags
The MCP `equipment_*` tools SHALL include the package's puck-prep flags (and the
derived `distribution`) in equipment reads, and SHALL accept the optional puck-prep
flags when creating or updating a package, alongside the grinder and basket
identity. Omitting them SHALL leave the package without puck prep. Puck-prep edits
SHALL flow through the same package-identity (dedup/fork) rules as grinder/basket edits.

#### Scenario: Equipment read includes puck prep
- **WHEN** an MCP equipment read resolves a package that has puck prep
- **THEN** the response SHALL include the set flags and the derived `distribution`

#### Scenario: Equipment write sets puck prep
- **WHEN** an MCP equipment write supplies one or more puck-prep flags
- **THEN** the package SHALL gain a `kind="puckprep"` item subject to the identity rules

### Requirement: MCP puck-prep fields SHALL follow the data conventions
Puck-prep fields exposed over MCP SHALL follow the project MCP conventions: boolean
flags with self-describing names (`wdt`, `shaker`, `puckScreen`, `paperFilter`,
`rdt`) and a human-readable `distribution` string rather than a numeric code.

#### Scenario: Puck-prep fields are LLM-legible
- **WHEN** the MCP dialing context emits the puck-prep sub-object
- **THEN** the flags SHALL be booleans and `distribution` SHALL be a readable string

### Requirement: Bag tools carry bean-detail fields

The `bag_update` tool SHALL accept the bean-detail parameters `origin`, `region`, `farm`, `producer`, `variety`, `elevation`, `process`, `harvest`, `qualityScore`, `placeOfPurchase`, `tastingNotes`, and `link` (product URL), merging them into the bag's `beanBaseData` blob with the same merge semantics as the bag editor (preserve link identity keys; clearing a value removes the key). A `bag_update` carrying detail fields SHALL trigger the same Visualizer edit-push as an editor save. `bag_list` and the `bag_update` response SHALL emit the stored detail fields as human-readable strings.

#### Scenario: Agent adds a URL and tasting notes
- **WHEN** an agent calls `bag_update` with `link` and `tastingNotes` for a bag
- **THEN** the blob SHALL carry both values, the response SHALL echo them
- **AND** the Visualizer push SHALL fire if the bag has a `visualizerBagId`

#### Scenario: Detail fields visible in bag_list
- **WHEN** an agent calls `bag_list`
- **THEN** each bag with stored details SHALL include them (origin, variety, process, tasting notes, link, etc.)

#### Scenario: Clearing a detail field
- **WHEN** an agent calls `bag_update` with `region` set to an empty string
- **THEN** the `region` key SHALL be removed from the blob and absent from subsequent reads

### Requirement: Recipe tool family
The MCP server SHALL register a recipe tool family (`mcptools_recipes.cpp`): `recipe_list`, `recipe_get`, `recipe_create`, `recipe_update`, `recipe_create_from_shot`, `recipe_clone`, `recipe_archive`, and `recipe_activate`. Read tools SHALL register at the read access level; mutating tools (create/update/clone/archive/activate/create_from_shot) at the write access level, matching the preset tools. `recipe_activate` SHALL invoke the same shared controller activation path as the UI. Lifecycle rules SHALL be enforced (archive-only for used recipes).

#### Scenario: AI saves a dialed-in shot
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `recipe_create_from_shot` with a shot id and a name
- **THEN** a recipe is created prefilled from that shot's record and steam snapshot, with provenance recorded

#### Scenario: AI clones a family variant
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `recipe_clone` and then `recipe_update` to change the milk weight and name
- **THEN** an independent recipe exists and the source recipe is unchanged

### Requirement: Recipe fields follow the data conventions
Recipe tool responses and inputs SHALL use the house conventions: unit-suffixed field names (`doseG`, `yieldG`, `milkWeightG`, `temperatureC`), ISO 8601 timestamps with timezone, human-readable enum strings, and grind expressed explicitly as an object `{"mode": "inherited"|"pinned", "value": <string>}` plus the resolved effective value, so a client never guesses where grind lives. Inherited grind SHALL resolve from the recipe's linked bag. Recipe responses SHALL expose the linked bag (`bagId` plus its display identity) and a human-readable staleness indication when the linked bag is no longer in inventory; `recipe_create` and `recipe_update` SHALL accept `bagId`. The optional hot-water block SHALL be accepted on create/update and returned on read via a tool schema that mirrors the steam block's pass-through handling — the same block the recipe stores, with each field's unit documented in its schema description (as the steam block does for `flow`), and with an `order` of `before` (long black) or `after` (Americano).

#### Scenario: Grind representation
- **WHEN** `recipe_get` returns a recipe that inherits grind from its linked bag
- **THEN** the response shows `"grind": {"mode": "inherited", "value": <linked bag's current grind>}`

#### Scenario: Bag link over MCP
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `recipe_get` on a recipe whose linked bag was finished
- **THEN** the response carries the `bagId`, the bag's display identity, and a human-readable stale indication

#### Scenario: Hot-water block round-trips over MCP
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `recipe_create` (or `recipe_update`) with a hot-water block and later calls `recipe_get`
- **THEN** the block is accepted against the tool schema, persisted, and returned unchanged (including its `order`)

### Requirement: Recipe tools carry drink type and accept profile-less hot-water recipes
The recipe tool family SHALL expose `drinkType` (human-readable string per the data conventions) on `recipe_list` and `recipe_get`, and accept it on `recipe_create`/`recipe_update` (derived from blocks when omitted; re-derived on update only when blocks change and the caller did not set it). Derivation SHALL resolve an installed profile's `beverage_type` from the profile catalog — recipes referencing installed profiles embed no profile JSON, and without the catalog a tea profile would derive as espresso. `recipe_create` and `recipe_update` SHALL accept a recipe with no profile when the payload carries a hot-water block with `hasWater` true, and SHALL reject a profile-less payload without one. `recipe_activate` on a profile-less recipe SHALL follow the shared profile-less activation path.

#### Scenario: Create hot-water tea recipe via MCP
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `recipe_create` with a name, a tea bean link, and a hot-water block but no profile
- **THEN** the recipe is created and `recipe_get` returns it with `drinkType` reflecting hot-water tea

#### Scenario: Profile-less without hot water rejected
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `recipe_create` with no profile and no hot-water block
- **THEN** the tool returns a validation error naming the rule

### Requirement: Bag tools expose kind
`bag_list` and bag detail payloads SHALL include the bag's `kind` (`"coffee"` or `"tea"`); `bag_update` SHALL NOT accept changing it (kind is set at creation). Tea bags' structured brewing fields (teaType, brewTempC, leafGramsPer100Ml, steepTime) SHALL appear in bag payloads following the data conventions (units in field names), and `bag_update` SHALL reject tea-vocabulary writes on a coffee bag with an error naming the rule (never a silent drop).

#### Scenario: Tea bag in bag_list
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `bag_list` with a tea bag in inventory
- **THEN** the bag carries kind "tea" and its stated brewing fields

#### Scenario: Kind is immutable via MCP
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `bag_update` attempting to change kind
- **THEN** the update is rejected or the field ignored with the response noting kind is creation-time only

### Requirement: Bags are creatable via MCP with kind stamped at creation
The MCP server SHALL provide `bag_create` (write access level): kind `coffee` (default) or `tea`, at least one of roasterName/coffeeName required, kind-gated vocabularies in both directions (tea fields rejected on coffee creates; roastLevel/grinderSetting rejected on tea creates), details landing in the bag blob via the shared merge helper. The created bag SHALL enter the inventory but SHALL NOT become the active bag (a remote client must not silently switch what the next shot is pulled with; `bag_select` activates).

#### Scenario: Create a tea bag with brewing data
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `bag_create` with kind "tea", a brand/name, teaType, and brewTempC
- **THEN** the bag appears in `bag_list` with kind "tea" and its brewing fields, and the active bag is unchanged

#### Scenario: Kind-gated create
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `bag_create` with kind "coffee" and a teaType
- **THEN** the create is rejected with an error naming the tea-only fields

### Requirement: Page extraction is drivable and diagnosable via MCP
The MCP server SHALL provide `bag_extract_details` (control tier): runs the exact in-app two-stage extraction for a bag's product URL (kind selects the coffee/tea vocabulary) and returns the extracted fields WITHOUT writing them, plus diagnostics — which stage ran, the stage-1 failure when the fallback fired, the provider and model, and the fetched text size. Applying fields is the caller's explicit `bag_update`.

#### Scenario: Stage-2 diagnosis on a JS-rendered shop
- **WHEN** an MCP client calls `bag_extract_details` for a bag whose page is a JS-rendered SPA
- **THEN** the response shows stage 2, the stage-1 emptyPage error, and the extracted fields including imageUrl when present
