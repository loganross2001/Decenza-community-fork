/**
 * On-demand discovery of WiFi scales on the LAN. Two mechanisms, run together
 * by a user-initiated scan:
 *
 *  - browse(): DNS-SD service browse for `_decentscale._tcp`. Finds every
 *    advertising scale regardless of its mDNS name, which is the only way to
 *    see a scale the user has renamed. Needs openscale >= v3.0.9.
 *  - probe(): direct A-record lookup of specific hostnames. Covers older
 *    firmware, which advertises no service at all.
 *
 * Nothing runs until a caller asks. That caller is USUALLY a user-initiated
 * scan, but not always: BLEManager also owns a separate instance for the
 * reconnect ladder, which browses when a saved WiFi scale's direct connect has
 * already failed. So a browse can be open without the user having asked for one
 * — bounded by that instance's own shorter deadline, gated on a saved WiFi
 * primary, and invisible to the Scan button because isScanning() references
 * only the scan's instance. See BLEManager::ensureReconnectDiscovery().
 *
 * A browse stops when its deadline elapses, when a new browse on the SAME
 * instance supersedes it, or at teardown. Instances do not cancel each other,
 * which is the whole reason the reconnect path has its own.
 *
 * Results arrive incrementally via resultFound() as each scale resolves, rather
 * than in one batch at the end — a live scale typically answers in well under a
 * second while the browse keeps running to its deadline.
 *
 * On non-Android the A-record path uses QHostInfo (the OS resolver speaks
 * mDNS); on Android it uses MdnsResolver on a worker thread, since Android's
 * getaddrinfo does not resolve ".local".
 *
 * The browse always goes through MdnsResolver::browseService() on every
 * platform; which backend that picks (system Bonjour vs the mjansson raw-socket
 * implementation) is decided inside. QHostInfo cannot browse on ANY platform —
 * it resolves a name you already know. See mdnsresolver.h.

    // alike. It lives here, above both, because it is a property of the
    // responder rather than of either caller.
    //
    // The HDS responder regularly takes 2-4 s to reply, likely the ESP32 waking
    // from WiFi power-save, so MdnsResolver's 2000 ms default is too short for
    // it. That is not a style preference: the reconnect path silently took the
    // 2000 ms default while discovery passed 5000, the two disagreed about a
    // documented property of the same device, and a tablet log showed 82
    // consecutive reconnect misses over 7.5 h — every one ending at ~2003 ms
    // having received nothing — against a scale that was awake and on mains
    // power throughout. A user-initiated scan 3 minutes after one of those
    // misses resolved the same hostname in 362 ms.
    //
    // Corroborated independently on macOS, which resolves through QHostInfo
    // rather than this mDNS path: a hostname fallback there took 3.68 s to
    // answer (log: "Resolving hdstest.local via QHostInfo..." at t=8.822 ->
    // resolved at t=12.504). Different OS, different resolver, same 2-4 s
    // band — so the latency is a property of the responder, not of any one
    // resolver implementation, and a 2 s deadline is too short for it
    // everywhere, not just on Android.
