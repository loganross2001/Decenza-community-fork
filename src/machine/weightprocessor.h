// Runs on a dedicated worker thread. Receives weight samples from the scale,
// computes LSLR flow rates, and makes SAW/per-frame-exit decisions
// independently of main thread congestion.
//
// Input (via QueuedConnection from main thread):
//   - processWeight(): called at the scale's own rate (2-10 Hz), and NOT
//     necessarily evenly — a transport may hand over several samples at
//     once, which is what the de-jitter block in processWeight() exists for
//   - configure(): called once at shot start with targets and learning data
//   - setTargetWeight(): may update SAW target mid-shot (e.g. user +10g bump)
//   - setCurrentFrame(): called at ~5Hz from DE1 shot samples
//
// Output (via QueuedConnection back to main thread):
//   - stopNow(triggerMs): triggers DE1Device::stopOperationUrgent(triggerMs)
//   - sawTriggered(weightAtStop, flowRateAtStop, targetWeight): carries context for SAW learning
//   - skipFrame(): triggers DE1Device::skipToNextFrame()
//   - flowRatesReady(): feeds ShotTimingController for graph/settling
