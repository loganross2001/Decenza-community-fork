## 1. Decide the translation mechanism (gates everything in group 3)

- [x] 1.1 Spike D1 in isolation: add `Q_PROPERTY(QJSValue translate READ translateFn NOTIFY
      translationsChanged)` to a scratch object, bind a `Text.text` to
      `Obj.translate("k", "f")`, emit the notify, and confirm the binding re-evaluates. Do this in
      a throwaway QML file or a unit test — NOT by sweeping the codebase first.
- [x] 1.2 Measure the cost of returning the callable: confirm the function object can be cached
      across evaluations and that constructing it does not require a live binding context.
- [x] 1.3 Confirm behaviour when `translate` is read but not called, and when it is called from a
      non-binding context (a signal handler, `Component.onCompleted`).
- [x] 1.4 Confirm the same mechanism covers the emoji resolver's async case (D4): a function whose
      return value changes when a fetch completes must re-render. If D1's mechanism handles
      translations but not this, say so — they may need different answers.
- [x] 1.5 Record the outcome in design.md — either D1 confirmed, or D1 killed and the codemod
      fallback adopted. State what was actually observed, not what was expected.

## 2. Emoji crash and escaping (independent of group 1; already written, needs verification)

- [x] 2.1 Review the working-tree changes to `Theme.replaceEmojiWithImg()` for the `allowMarkup`
      parameter and default-escaping behaviour.
- [x] 2.2 Audit all 26 `replaceEmojiWithImg()` call sites and confirm each is correctly classified.
      5 opt-ins: `ExpandableTextArea`, `CustomEditorPopup`, `CustomItem`, and the two
      <font>-highlight sites (`ShotDetailPage`, `PostShotReviewPage`); the remaining 21 are escaped — pay particular attention to the sites that
      build a `result` string (`ShotDetailPage`, `PostShotReviewPage`, `ShotHistoryPage`) and to
      `ConversationOverlay`, whose text comes from `AIConversation::getConversationText()`.
- [x] 2.3 Confirm `ShotDetailPage:357` still renders its `<font color=...>` highlight — it builds
      markup deliberately and calls `escapeHtml()` on the name itself, so it may need the opt-in.
- [x] 2.4 Verify the release-notes field in the running app. DONE, and it found a real bug I
      had hedged about instead of confirming: an inline `<img>` truncates the rest of a
      Markdown document in Qt, so the notes rendered only up to the first emoji. Fixed by
      converting markdown -> HTML BEFORE injecting emoji (`MarkdownRenderer`, see D8).
      Verified in the running app: emoji render at inline size, headings/bold/bullets intact,
      scrolls to the end with no truncation.
- [x] 2.5 Correct the `CurveTextRendering` comment in `src/main.cpp` (already in the working tree —
      re-read it after the #1549 merge and confirm it reads coherently in its new surroundings).
- [x] 2.6 Add a test that asserts `replaceEmojiWithImg()` escapes by default and preserves markup
      when `allowMarkup` is true.

## 3. Emoji asset set (CDN design REVERSED — see design.md D4)

Originally a CDN resolver with a disk cache. Measuring the install-size cost it was avoiding
(+2.8 MB compressed, on a 137 MB bundle) reversed the decision: ship all 4,009 assets, delete the
runtime network path entirely. Former tasks 3.2-3.5 and 3.9-3.10 (resolver, caches, async
re-render, offline behaviour, eviction) no longer exist.

- [x] 3.1 Settle the upstream source and filename pattern. DONE: `jdecked/twemoji@17.0.3` via
      jsDelivr, now a BUILD-TIME source only. `twitter/twemoji` is NOT archived (an earlier note
      here said it was — wrong), but its last release is v14.0.2 from March 2022 and it 404s on
      Unicode 15+. Byte-identical for overlapping assets, so regenerating does not restyle the 744
      already shipping. Skin-tone, ZWJ, flag, keycap and `©` sequences verified by real requests;
      U+FE0F must be stripped from the key (`31-20e3` 200, `31-fe0f-20e3` 404).
- [x] 3.2 Close the variation-selector crash path: keycaps and `©️ ®️ ™️` matched no codepoint range
      and reached the platform colour renderer. Both new tests verified to fail without the fix.
- [x] 3.3 Point `scripts/download_emoji.py` at `jdecked/twemoji@17.0.3` and give it a mode that
      fetches the COMPLETE upstream set rather than only the codepoints `EmojiData.js` lists.
- [x] 3.4 Run it: ~4,009 assets into `resources/emoji/`, regenerate `resources/emoji.qrc`, commit.
      Sanity-check the count and total size against the measured figures (4,009 files, 9.65 MB raw)
      rather than assuming the run was complete.
- [x] 3.5 Add the existence check so an emoji with no asset is STRIPPED rather than emitted as an
      unresolvable `qrc:` path. This is the broken-image bug and it is not fixed by bundling more —
      a Unicode 18 emoji still misses. Applies to both `emojiToImage()` and `replaceEmojiWithImg()`.
- [x] 3.6 Verify the strip path with a test: an emoji known to be outside the set produces no
      `<img>` and leaves surrounding text intact.
- [x] 3.7 Confirm what the regeneration changed. RESULT: 3,265 added, 0 deleted, and **8 of 744
      modified** (🌁 🍉 🏥 🔒 🔓 🚑 🤡 🥺) — my prediction of "no modifications" was wrong, having
      generalised a byte-identity check on one asset to all 744. Mostly upstream path optimisation
      (arcs for béziers; 🥺 2277→1428 bytes, same shape); 🔒 is a genuine redraw, now spanning the
      full viewBox height. Fine to take, but it is a visual change and is recorded as one.

## 4. Translation reactivity (blocked on 1.5)

- [x] 4.1 Implement whichever mechanism task 1 selected.
- [x] 4.2 Rename the C++ entry point (`translateString()`) and update the 10 C++ callers (I said
      11 earlier — miscounted a comment line as a call):
      `main.cpp`, `updatechecker`, `databasebackupmanager`, `blemanager`, `visualizerimporter`,
      `visualizeruploader`, `aiprovider`, `aimanager`, `aiconversation`, `livesteamcoach`.
- [x] 4.3 Add the regression guard test per D2 — under D1, assert the QML-facing `translate` is a
      notifying property; under the codemod fallback, assert no bare `translate(` survives in
      `qml/`.
- [x] 4.4 Verify the guard actually fails: deliberately revert the mechanism, watch the test go
      red, then restore. Do not claim the guard works without having seen it fail.
- [x] 4.5 Confirm `Tr.qml` still behaves correctly and decide whether its `translationVersion`
      touch stays (design leans yes, as documentation).

## 5. Documentation

- [x] 5.1 Rewrite the i18n bullet in `CLAUDE.md` (currently around line 81) so the documented
      pattern is the reactive one. The current text recommends the bare call that this change
      exists to fix.
- [x] 5.2 Rework the glyph rule in `CLAUDE.md` per D6. The current bullet bans Unicode glyphs as
      icons outright and lists a "safe" set. Rewrite it to say: pictographic emoji are fine and
      resolve to images (state the resolution order and that unresolvable ones are stripped);
      non-emoji text symbols (`→`, `←`, `▶`, `☰`) remain unsafe because they are rendered by the
      bundled font, are absent from its cmap, and vary per machine. Do NOT delete the section —
      the two concerns are different and only one is fixed here.
- [x] 5.3 Document the build rule in `CLAUDE.md` alongside the existing "new QML files must be
      added to CMakeLists.txt" convention: using a new emoji requires no manual asset step, the
      build fetches and commits it.
- [x] 5.4 Update `docs/CLAUDE_MD/EMOJI_SYSTEM.md` for the new resolution order, the cache, and the
      build step. Its "Adding New Emojis" section currently prescribes a manual 3-step process that
      this change makes obsolete.
- [x] 5.5 Check `docs/CLAUDE_MD/QML_GOTCHAS.md` for the invokable-in-binding trap and add it if
      absent — it has now been hit three times in one session (`effectiveFontSizes`,
      `canAutoTranslate`, `translate`), and D4 would have been a fourth.
- [ ] 5.6 Update the wiki manual only if user-visible behaviour changed. A language switch taking
      effect without a restart is user-visible; check whether the manual currently tells users to
      restart.

## 6. Verification

- [ ] 6.1 Build via Qt Creator; zero errors and zero new warnings.
- [ ] 6.2 Run the full test suite; all suites pass.
- [x] 6.3 Language switch verified live via MCP + screenshots: English -> German retranslated
      the whole UI with NO restart (Rezepte/Bohnen/Dampf/Bereit/Spülen/Verlauf/…), and German ->
      English left no residue. RESIDUAL: page titles are set by imperative assignment in
      StackView.onActivated (35 sites), not bindings, so they keep the language active when the
      page was last activated and self-heal on navigation. See 6.9.
- [x] 6.4 Update tab opened against v2.0.0 notes (which contain emoji): no crash, emoji render
      as bundled SVGs at inline size, full content present.
- [ ] 6.9 DECIDE: fix the 35 imperative `currentPageTitle` assignments so page titles retranslate
      live. Needs each page to expose a `pageTitle` property and main.qml to bind it — a
      one-line change per page plus a small refactor. Not done: it is a separate shape of bug
      from the binding fix, and this change is already large.
- [ ] 6.5 Check pages that display externally-sourced text after the escaping change — bean names,
      recipe names, shot history, screensaver author, AI conversation — and confirm no raw tags
      appear.
- [ ] 6.6 Exercise an emoji outside the bundled 745 in a bean name or recipe name: confirm it
      fetches and renders, survives a restart, and strips cleanly with the network off.
- [ ] 6.7 Verify on Android. The escaping change affects every platform, and the font work that
      preceded this was verified on macOS only.
- [ ] 6.8 Verify on Windows.

## 6b. Observed in testing — NOT this change's code, decide separately

- [ ] 6.10 The Language tab contradicts itself on ONE card: it shows German as `2974 / 2977`
      and, directly below, "Translation complete!". Two code paths round the same 99.899%
      differently:
        - `translationmanager.cpp:1149` `(translated * 100) / total` — integer division,
          truncates to **99%** (the language list)
        - `SettingsLanguageTab.qml:278` `Math.round((translated/total) * 100)` — rounds to
          **100**, which then trips `if (percent === 100) return "Translation complete!"`
      Truncation is the safer of the two (it cannot claim 100 while anything is missing), so
      the QML side is the one to change. Two lines. `SettingsLanguageTab.qml` is NOT touched
      by this change, so this is a deliberate scope call, not an oversight.
- [ ] 6.11 The 3 untranslated German strings are all long, multi-line MCP help text
      (`settings.ai.mcp.help.capabilities` / `.platformNote` / `.steps`). Every other string in
      the batch translated. Check whether the AI translation path skips or silently fails on
      strings past some length — if so, that is a real gap, not a coverage statistic.
- [ ] 6.12 The percentage's DENOMINATOR may be wrong: it counts the string registry (2,977),
      but `machineStatus.idle` is absent from the registry entirely — so it is invisible to
      both the percentage AND to AI translation, and can never be translated. That is why
      "Idle" stayed English while the rest of the UI switched to German (see 6.3). 450 keys
      also have German translations but are not in the registry, so the two have drifted in
      both directions. CAVEAT: `string_registry.json` on disk was last written 12:46 while the
      app started 15:01, so re-check against a freshly saved registry before treating the
      450-key drift as established.

## 7. Custom icon audit (investigation only — no swaps in this change)

Motivation: 69 bespoke SVGs in `resources/icons/` are a maintenance burden, and standard emoji are
more widely recognised. The blocker is that these icons are monochrome and theme-tinted via
`ThemedIcon.qml` (`MultiEffect { colorization: 1.0; colorizationColor: Theme.iconColor }`, used
across 41 QML files), while emoji are fixed multi-colour. Colorising an emoji at 1.0 flattens it to
a silhouette; not colorising drops it out of the theme entirely. This group produces the data to
decide with, rather than guessing.

- [ ] 7.1 Classify all 69 icons in `resources/icons/` into: (a) a standard emoji is a genuine
      equivalent, (b) no emoji equivalent exists, (c) an equivalent exists but the icon is
      theming-critical. Record the proposed emoji codepoint for every (a).
- [ ] 7.2 For each (a), note where it is used and whether that context tints it. An icon that is
      never tinted is a much cheaper swap than one in themed chrome.
- [ ] 7.3 Build a side-by-side visual comparison of the candidates — themed SVG vs Twemoji — in
      both light and dark mode. The theming loss has to be seen, not described.
- [ ] 7.4 BOTH of my original objections to the icon swap are now dead, so 7.1-7.3 decide it on
      merit rather than on my reservations:
      (a) Offline/CDN — gone. Everything is bundled; nothing fetches at runtime.
      (b) Theming — OpenMoji ships a `black/` tree of MONOCHROME line-art built exactly like our
      icons: `fill="none"` + a single `stroke`, same as `resources/icons/*.svg`. So a swapped
      icon CAN follow `Theme.iconColor` through ThemedIcon after all.
      One thing to actually test rather than assume: our icons stroke WHITE and ThemedIcon's
      comment says white is what makes `MultiEffect { colorization: 1.0 }` work; OpenMoji black
      strokes `#000`. Colorising a black source may not produce a light tint. Test it before
      concluding the swap is viable — this is the whole question now.
      Also note OpenMoji is CC-BY-SA (share-alike) where Twemoji is MIT, and it has no
      equivalent for `flush`, `espresso 8mm`, `niche-zero`, `decent-de1`, `body-*`, `taste-*`.
- [ ] 7.5 Present the classification and comparison to Jeff and get a decision. Do NOT swap any
      icon in this change — a follow-up change carries whatever is agreed.

## 8. Close-out

- [ ] 8.1 Archive this change with `/opsx:archive` as the last commit on the branch, before merge.
