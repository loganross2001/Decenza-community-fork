// ShotProjection — typed value-type representation of a fully-loaded ShotRecord.
//
// Replaces the stringly-typed QVariantMap that ShotHistoryStorage::convertShotRecord
// used to return. Field access through Q_PROPERTYs gives compile-time safety on the
// C++ side (`shot.finalWeightG` instead of `shot["finalWeightG"].toDouble()`) while
// QML continues to read fields by name (`shotData.finalWeightG`) because the QML
// engine surfaces Q_PROPERTYs of a Q_GADGET as JS properties — the access syntax is
// identical to the previous QVariantMap shape.
//
// Field names match the legacy QVariantMap keys exactly so QML, MCP JSON, and any
// QVariantMap-flavoured consumers (Object.assign in QML, exporter pipeline) stay
// compatible. toVariantMap()/toJsonObject() are provided for the few consumers
// that still need a map (web HTML rendering, JSON serialisation for MCP, the
// visualizer.coffee uploader's JSON builder).
