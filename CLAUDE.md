# Decenza

Qt/C++ cross-platform controller for the Decent Espresso DE1 machine with BLE connectivity.

## User Manual

The end-user manual lives in the GitHub wiki at https://github.com/Kulitorum/Decenza/wiki/Manual. Consult it when working on user-visible behaviour to confirm documented expectations or the official wording for features. The wiki is a separate git repo (`Kulitorum/Decenza.wiki.git`) — clone it locally if you need to edit a manual page.

**Write manual entries SHORT.** The manual is read by people standing at a machine wanting an answer, not by anyone studying the feature. A new section is typically 3-5 sentences: what it is, where to find it, and the one rule that is not obvious. A table earns its place when it replaces prose; a paragraph explaining the rationale behind a design decision does not — that belongs in the code or the OpenSpec change, not here. Edge cases, failure modes and "why we built it this way" are exactly what makes a page nobody finishes.

This needs saying because the failure is one-directional and constant: an assistant writing docs will produce four paragraphs where four sentences do, every time, and each one reads as reasonable in isolation. When you finish a manual entry, cut it by half before committing it. If something in the cut half is genuinely load-bearing, it is usually a sign the FEATURE needs to be clearer, not the doc longer.

**When adding or changing a user-visible feature, update the wiki manual as part of that work** — add a task for it in the change's `tasks.md` (or do it directly for small fixes). Don't leave it as an afterthought; a shipped feature with no manual entry is incomplete.

Read [`docs/SHOT_REVIEW.md`](https://github.com/Kulitorum/Decenza/blob/main/docs/SHOT_REVIEW.md) when working on the post-shot review / shot detail pages, the five quality-badge detectors (pour truncated, channeling, grind issue, temperature unstable, skip-first-frame), the Shot Summary dialog, badge persistence, or `src/ai/shotanalysis.{h,cpp}`. It is the source of truth for detector internals, gate semantics, and the recompute-on-load contract; keep it in sync when changing any of the above.

## Development Environment

- **ADB path**: `/c/Users/Micro/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe`
- **Uninstall app**: `adb uninstall io.github.kulitorum.decenza_de1`
- **WiFi debugging**: `192.168.1.212:5555` (reconnect: `adb connect 192.168.1.212:5555`). The DHCP lease can rotate — if reconnect fails, plug in USB and run `adb shell ip route | grep wlan` to read the current IP, then `adb tcpip 5555` + `adb connect <ip>:5555`.
- **Qt version**: 6.11.2
- **Qt path**: `C:/Qt/6.11.2/msvc2022_64`
- **Qt sources**: `~/Qt/6.11.2/Src` (macOS) — the full source tree for the exact version we build against. **Read it instead of guessing at Qt behaviour, and cite file-and-line in any comment that asserts what Qt does.** An un-sourced claim in a comment gets believed and then licenses wrong code: both bugs below were written as settled fact first and found by opening the source much later.
  - Error handling is not inferable from the enum names — several `errno` values collapse onto one `QAbstractSocket::SocketError`, per platform, and `connectToHost()` with an IP literal can emit `errorOccurred` **synchronously** (`qtbase/src/network/socket/qnativesocketengine_unix.cpp`, `qabstractsocket.cpp`).
  - Neither is the object model — a registered singleton with no instance is **truthy**, not `undefined` (`qtdeclarative/src/qml/jsruntime/qv4qmlcontext.cpp:229`). See `QML_GOTCHAS.md`.
- **No local Qt contribution checkout.** `~/Development/GitHub/qtbase` and `~/Development/GitHub/qtdeclarative` were Gerrit clones for upstreaming patches; they were deleted with the 6.11.2 upgrade, once every patch they carried was either shipped upstream or preserved as source. Clone fresh from Gerrit if you need to contribute again. **`~/Qt/6.11.2/Src` is the copy to read for reference** — a contribution clone never was, since it sits on whatever branch is in flight.
- **Decenza ships stock Qt.** No patched platform plugin, jar, framework or library is committed or packaged. A Qt bug is fixed upstream, worked around in Decenza's own code, or accepted as a known issue. Patches kept only as source (not built, not shipped) live in `docs/qt-patches/`, each with its upstream bug and the condition under which it would come back.
- **C++ standard**: C++17
- **de1app source**: `C:\code\de1app` (Windows) or `/Users/jeffreyh/Development/GitHub/de1app` (macOS) — original Tcl/Tk DE1 app for reference
- **IMPORTANT**: Use relative paths (e.g., `src/main.cpp`) instead of absolute paths (e.g., `C:\CODE\de1-qt\src\main.cpp`) to avoid "Error: UNKNOWN: unknown error, open" when editing files

## Building

**An assistant builds and runs tests through the Qt Creator MCP tools — `mcp__qtcreator__build` and `mcp__qtcreator__run_tests` — and through nothing else.** Not `cmake --build`, not `ctest`, not a `./tests/tst_*` binary, from any shell. That holds for the full pre-PR suite, for a single target, and when an MCP call times out (the call's wait can abort while Qt Creator keeps building — poll `get_build_status`, don't shell out). If the MCP path is blocked — wrong startup project, app holding the binary, tool unavailable — **stop and ask**. Qt Creator is also ~50× faster than a CLI build, and it is the environment the maintainer is watching while you work.

The `cmake`/`ctest` invocations in `docs/CLAUDE_MD/TESTING.md` and `docs/CLAUDE_MD/PLATFORM_BUILD.md` are **reference for humans and CI**, not instructions for an assistant. Run their equivalent through the MCP.

**No CI job builds or tests a pull request *automatically* — run the full suite locally before opening one.** That is the default gate, via `mcp__qtcreator__run_tests` (scope `all`). Nothing on GitHub fires on its own to catch a compile error or a failing test before merge.

**But CI can be pointed at a branch on demand, and for the test suite that is `linux-release.yml`.** It configures `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON` and runs `ctest --output-on-failure --repeat until-pass:3`, then reports any test that only passed on retry. It is `workflow_dispatch`, so it runs only when dispatched:

```bash
gh workflow run linux-release.yml --ref <branch> -f upload_to_release=false
```

Read "no PR CI" as "nothing runs unless you ask", not "there is no way to get CI to build and test this branch" — the second reading is wrong, and it is how this file was previously read into telling a contributor the suite could only be run locally. The other release workflows dispatch the same way and are the right call for platform-specific changes; `linux-release.yml` is the one that runs tests. Note what a Linux run does **not** cover: `ENABLE_TSNET` is OFF there, so anything reached only through `cmake/tsnet.cmake` is not exercised, and platform-guarded code is compiled only by that platform's own workflow.

That is narrower than "there is no PR CI", which this file used to say and which is wrong: `text-invariants.yml` **does** run on `pull_request`, filtered to the surfaces in its own `paths:` list — **`src/**` among them**. (Not enumerated here: the two copies of that list in this repo's docs were each already one entry short.)

**`src/**` is in that list, so a pure C++ change is gated too**, and this file used to omit it. That omission is what let a merge land red: `check_log_markers.py` rejected a new `[Equipment]` line in `maincontroller.cpp`, the PR was merged without its own run being read, and `main` went red. Nothing blocks that — it is not a required status check, by design, because requiring it would put a check on the critical path of every push. **Read the run before you merge; the gate cannot do it for you.** It is build-free by design — pure Python over the source, no Qt, no compile, seconds (the workflow header carries the measured figure) — which is exactly why it can afford to run per-PR while nothing else does. Read it as the shape a new PR-time check has to fit: if a check needs the app built, it does not belong there.

Everything else is post-merge or on demand — "on demand" meaning the `workflow_dispatch` release workflows above, which is a real option and not a euphemism for "never". `nightly-sanitizers.yml` re-runs the suite on `main` each night under UBSan and ASan. Platform-guarded code (`#ifdef Q_OS_IOS` etc.) is compiled only by the tag-push release workflows, so verify platform-specific changes with a CI test build of that platform (see `docs/CLAUDE_MD/CI_CD.md`).

**Debug builds are sanitizer-instrumented automatically** — ASan *and* UBSan on every desktop platform including macOS, so a normal local test run already reports undefined behaviour and memory errors. UBSan is in recovering mode there (it reports and continues); an explicit `-DENABLE_UBSAN=ON` gives the halting mode CI uses. Release builds are untouched.

**But LeakSanitizer does not exist on macOS, so a green local run says nothing about leaks.** `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1` is refused outright — `AddressSanitizer: detect_leaks is not supported on this platform`. LSan is Linux-only, so on a Mac ASan covers use-after-free, buffer overflow and double-free, and cannot see a leak at all. The nightly Linux ASan job is the only place leaks are detected; it found two the local suite had passed over for months. To chase a leak on macOS use `leaks <pid>` or `MallocStackLogging=1`, not ASan.

## Conventions

### Design Principles
- **Never use timers as guards/workarounds.** Timers are fragile heuristics that break on slow devices and hide the real problem. Use event-based flags and conditions instead. For example, "suppress X until Y has happened" should be a boolean cleared by the Y event, not a timer. Only use timers for genuinely periodic tasks (polling, animation, heartbeats) and **UI auto-dismiss** (toasts/banners that hide after N seconds). Everything else — including debounce — should use event-based flags.
- **Keep main-thread database and disk I/O off anything a user can feel, and off anything that could interfere with making coffee.** That is what the rule protects — it is not a ban on touching `QSqlQuery` from the main thread, and reading it that way produces caches far more expensive than the thing they avoid. Judge by magnitude and by where the work sits:
  - **Thread it** when the read is unbounded or grows with history (shot lists, `debug_log`/`profile_json` blob reads, exports, backups, migrating existing rows), or when it sits on a repeating path — a binding that re-evaluates on every change, a model delegate, anything per-frame or per-sample. Use `QThread::create()` with a `QMetaObject::invokeMethod(..., Qt::QueuedConnection)` callback; `ShotHistoryStorage::requestShot()` is the canonical pattern. For connections inside background threads always use `withTempDb()` from `src/core/dbutils.h` — unique connection naming, `busy_timeout`, `foreign_keys`, cleanup. Never hand-roll `QSqlDatabase::addDatabase()`/`removeDatabase()` where `withTempDb` fits.
  - **Inline is fine** for a small bounded read on a discrete user action. Measure it on a realistic database and on a multiple of one (a scan's cost tracks table BYTES, not row count: a page read drags the blobs along), then put the median AND the worst case in a comment at the call site so the next person inherits the evidence rather than the conclusion. **Confirm "discrete" against the QML, not against intent.** Two shapes to check, both of which shipped wrong in one PR. A `readonly property` on a component the layout keeps resident evaluates at construction and on every dependency change, not when the user opens anything — `grindStepForGrinder()` was documented as running "when the grind picker opens" while its binding re-ran on an unrelated signal across every live `GrindRowSource`, because `GrindQuickSelectItem` is a bar widget. And a binding that reads a property the user's typing rewrites runs **per keystroke**: `getDistinctBaristas()` sat inside a `suggestions:` binding that read `editBarista`, which `onTextEdited` rewrote on every character. Trace each binding's dependencies to a writer and count the evaluations before claiming a read is on a user action. The fix for the keystroke case is to hoist the query to a property refreshed at defined moments, not to thread it.
  - **While the machine is running** — shot, steam, flush, hot water — the main thread is carrying BLE traffic and live telemetry, so the budget is much tighter than at idle, but it is still a budget, not a prohibition. A few ms against a ~100 ms sample interval is not a hazard; tens of ms is. Anything that could delay a stop-at-weight or a stop command belongs on a thread regardless of its average.
  - **The tradeoff runs both ways, and the expensive side is usually the cache.** `ShotHistoryStorage`'s distinct-value cache existed to keep dialog and picker reads off the database, and it was invalidated *more often than it was read* — every shot save, delete and metadata edit wiped it and kicked a six-query refresh, to serve dialogs that might never open. Its invalidation also dropped composite keys it never refilled: a correctly-derived grind step of 0.25 lost, the re-fetch discarded mid-flight, and the picker stuck on 1.0 for the session. (That cache bug has no issue number of its own — it was found from a device log. Do not cite #1713 for it: #1713 is the equipment-identity fork, a different mechanism that happens to produce the same visible symptom.) Deleting it removed the bug rather than fixing it. Measurements live at the call sites (`queryDistinctList`, `grinderWideNumericSettings` and `grinderWideRpms` in `shothistorystorage_queries.cpp`), not here — next to the code they justify. Pay for threading or caching where a user or the machine would notice. Nowhere else.
- **A configured API key is not permission to spend on it.** Any feature that calls a paid AI provider uses the provider AND model the user selected, and nothing else. Never fall back to another provider because one errored or rate-limited, and never pick a provider because it happens to have a key — a user with OpenAI selected must not get billed on Anthropic. When the selected provider fails, stop and report which provider failed at what; a run that reports success having silently used something else is worse than a run that ends. Decenza's bulk translator did exactly this for months, hard-ordering "Claude first (best quality), then OpenAI", and the silent substitution hid a retired Anthropic model that made every Anthropic request 404 — visible only to users with no second key.
- **A test has to be able to fail, has to catch something the suite does not, and costs BUILD time rather than run time.** The suite runs in ~31 s; an individual test is 50-80 ms — noise. The cost is that `tests/` is **40% of a clean build** (1956 s of 4846 s cpu) and the suite doubled in July 2026 alone. Where that goes is not where it is usually assumed: production sources recompiled inside test targets 35.2%, test source TUs 31.9%, moc 26.5%, qrc 3.4%, **link 3.0%**. Those shares are contended wall clock from a parallel build, so read them as proportions, never as durations. **"Target count is the smallest lever" is true of LINK and false of compile** — that sentence used to stand unqualified here and it pointed at the wrong unit. Measured since: `#include <QtTest>` alone costs 1.42 s and a whole 60-line test file costs 1.45 s, so ~90% of a test TU's compile is fixed per FILE and ~10% scales with lines (~1.4 s + ~0.83 ms/line, r=0.35 over 109 TUs). A new `tst_*.cpp` costs ~1.4 s forever; a new test slot in an existing file costs milliseconds. So make a new test FILE hard to justify and a new test FUNCTION easy, and do not expect deleting tests to buy build time — an audit of all 2,515 tests found 93 mergeable into `_data()` tables and 239 under three lines, together worth under a second. The lever that did work was precompiled headers (`DECENZA_ENABLE_PCH`), 31.6% off a clean rebuild with no test deleted. Say what defect shape a new test catches that no existing test catches; if you cannot, extend the existing assertion instead, and if it is more cases of an already-covered shape, call it insurance and argue it on risk. One invariant is asserted in one place. Shared production sources go into a **narrow** intermediate library linked by exactly the targets that need them, never into the universally-linked `decenza_testlib` — that trades a compile fan-out of 9 for a link fan-out of 106 and recovers only a seventh of what a narrow library does (measured: touching `profilemanager.cpp` cost 77.0 s across nine duplicate compiles, 12.2 s after). This is **enforced per-PR** by `scripts/check_test_source_duplication.py` in `text-invariants.yml`, which is why the tree is at zero duplicates rather than carrying an exception list. Before keeping a test, break the code it covers and watch it go red: a test that cannot fail is a comment that compiles, and deleting one is a strict improvement. Full rules, the measured tables, and the three pass-forever shapes that have shipped here, are in `docs/CLAUDE_MD/TESTING.md` under "Adding New Tests".
- **Complexity has to come with a measurable win, stated in units the USER feels.** Not "33.9 ms → 1.18 ms" — *who waits for those milliseconds?* A saving on a background thread, at startup, that nothing blocks on is not a win, however large the ratio. Write the benefit as "X, which the user experiences as Y" before adding the machinery; if Y is empty, so is the case for it. This is the check the rest of the process does not do: build, tests and the PR review agents all ask whether code is CORRECT, and over-built code almost always is — a covering index nobody needed passed 110 tests and was *praised* by the review agents.
  - **Re-derive the justification when the design around it moves.** That index was justified by "a visible hitch every time the grind picker opens" — true of an on-demand read, false the moment the value became resident. The comment was never revisited, so a stale premise kept a schema migration alive through a full review. The same sentence then survived the migration's deletion and was still wrong for a *third* reason (the binding was never on picker-open at all). When you change how something is read or called, re-read the comments justifying its optimisations: they are claims with expiry dates, and a comment nobody re-derives is how a bad decision keeps getting re-approved.
  - **Needing fault injection to reach a branch is a stop sign, not a testing problem.** If the only way to exercise a path is to fake a failure that cannot otherwise occur, ask whether the path should exist before you build the harness. Writing exactly that harness is what exposed the over-build above.
- **Don't engineer around migrations. They run once, with the app stopped.** Every migration executes synchronously inside `ShotHistoryStorage::initialize()` (`runMigrations()` at `src/history/shothistorystorage.cpp:198`), which does not set `m_ready` or emit `readyChanged()` until the whole chain is done (`:243`) — so no reader, background thread or UI, can ever observe a half-migrated database. Check those two lines rather than believing this one. That means the concurrency defences a migration seems to invite are guarding nothing: don't add "is a migration running" flags, don't make readers skip or wait, don't build retry/verify machinery for a state no one can see. Just do the work and stamp the version.
  - **Gate the version bump only on things that are schema facts.** A column, a table, a data backfill — bump only if it landed, because the app would be wrong without it. A performance index is not one of those: the queries return identical results without it, so create it, log the failure if it fails, and bump anyway — gating the version on it only buys a database that fails `CREATE INDEX` once and re-runs the block on every launch forever. The stamp of `schema_version` itself stays transacted, and that one IS a correctness fact: a `DELETE` that commits without its `INSERT` leaves the table empty, and an empty `schema_version` on an already-migrated database is not recoverable — `createTables()` re-seeds it to 1 (`shothistorystorage.cpp:393`), the whole chain then re-runs against tables that already exist, several steps fail, and `initialize()` returns false. Verified by writing that case as a test and watching it strand at version 14. So keep the DELETE and the INSERT in one transaction; do not reach for a `crossedSchemaVersion()` argument, which is a different and largely foreclosed concern.
- **Settings go in their domain sub-object, not on `Settings` directly.** `Settings` is a façade owning 12 domain classes (`SettingsMqtt`, `SettingsTheme`, …). Add properties to the matching `Settings<Domain>`, or add a new sub-object; never back onto `Settings` itself. QML access is **always** `Settings.<domain>.<prop>`, never the flat `Settings.<prop>`. A new sub-object needs three edits and missing the third (`QML_FOREIGN` + `QML_UNCREATABLE` in `settings_qml.h`) resolves to `undefined` at runtime while compiling clean. Two traps that cost real time — the domain types must NOT be erased to `QObject*`, and `Q_DECLARE_OPAQUE_POINTER` is not a way around it — are in `docs/CLAUDE_MD/SETTINGS.md` with the full checklist and the measured build cost. Read it before adding a domain.
- **Centralize anything produced at more than one site — never hand-roll it per call, never copy a helper's body.** A repeated format, prefix, tag, wording, or policy is a drift opportunity: each copy is free to change alone, silently, and nothing fails when one does. Put it behind one function or macro and call that. This is not a tidiness preference, it is how the copies stay true to each other.
  - **Never copy a macro/helper body to specialize it** — alias it. `difluidr1.cpp` and `difluidr2.cpp` each hand-copied `SCALE_LOG`/`SCALE_WARN` from `scalelogging.h` instead of aliasing, so a one-line fix to the shared macro had to be found and applied in three places; the two copies were only still identical by luck. `#define R1_LOG(msg) SCALE_LOG("DiFluidR1", msg)` is the correct shape.
  - **A log/error prefix belongs in one helper, not at the call site.** `usbscalemanager.cpp` wrote `"[USB Scale] "` inline at 73 sites with no helper, and drifted exactly as predicted: at 21 of them the `qDebug` and the `emit logMessage` described the same event in *different words*. Worse, a comment was then written asserting the two were deliberately "separate", which made the drift look like a design. Prefixes also multiplied to four families (`[Scale]`, `[BLE <Driver>]`, `[USB Scale]`, `[WifiScaleDiscovery]`) so no single `grep` returned the whole story — and this subsystem is diagnosed from user-submitted logs, where a reader cannot know which family they forgot.
  - **A generated web page's CSS/HTML/JS is code, and the same rule binds it.** The `.lib-toast` bottom-centre message was hand-written twice — once in `shotserver_layout.cpp`, once in `webtemplates/theme_css.h`/`theme_html.h`/`theme_js.h` — and had drifted in five style values (including a z-index of 9999 against 300) plus one behavioural one: only the layout copy cleared its dismiss timer, so on the theme page a second toast inherited the first's countdown and vanished early. Nothing failed; the two pages simply never render together. It is now `WEB_CSS_TOAST` / `WEB_HTML_TOAST` / `WEB_JS_TOAST` in `webtemplates/toast.h`, with the one genuinely per-page value (its place in that page's stack) as a `var(--z-toast, …)` override rather than a second copy.
  - When you find yourself about to write the second copy, stop and extract. When you touch code that already has copies, collapse them in that pass — see the pre-existing-issues rule under Accessibility, which applies to all code, not just QML.
  - **Take the opportunity when you see it, even when it is not what you were asked to do.** A duplicate spotted in passing is the cheapest it will ever be to remove: right now it is one extraction, and every later edit to either copy is a chance for them to diverge silently. Extracting costs more up front than leaving it — do it anyway, in the same change, and say so in the PR. The bar is that the extraction is real (one definition, all callers on it), not that the diff stays small.

### C++
- Classes: `PascalCase`; methods/variables: `camelCase`; members: `m_` prefix; slots: `onEventName()`
- Use `Q_PROPERTY` with `NOTIFY` for bindable properties
- Use `qsizetype` (not `int`) for container sizes — `QVector::size()`, `QList::size()`, `QString::size()` etc. return `qsizetype` (64-bit on iOS/macOS). Assigning to `int` causes `-Wshorten-64-to-32` warnings.
- **Adding a log line? Read `docs/CLAUDE_MD/LOGGING.md` first — it is a gate, not advice.** `scripts/check_log_markers.py` fails the build-free PR job on a bare `qDebug` in a covered file, a marker typed by hand, or a leading `[Capitalised]` token the registry does not declare — the last only in a log call, in a file one of the glob sets covers. Three things that keep going wrong and are all in that doc:
  - **The tier is chosen by AUDIENCE, not importance.** `INFO` is the user-visible tier: the connections views default to `minLevel INFO` and none of them override it, so a user-facing line left at `DEBUG` is absent from the views entirely. (`debug_get_log` has no such default — it filters only if the caller asks — but it is normally called that way.) The recurring shape is a fault reported at `WARN` whose *resolution* sits at `DEBUG`: the reader sees only the failure half and concludes it never recovered.
  - **Which file you are in decides which rules apply.** A file wholly about one subsystem goes in `COVERED_GLOBS`; a file that merely *hosts* a subsystem's lines beside unrelated code goes in `MARKER_ONLY_GLOBS`. Both lists live in the script and are deliberately not restated in the docs. Touching a file that uses a helper and is in neither list fails the gate.
  - **Nothing blocks a merge on that gate.** It is not a required status check, so a red run is only caught by someone reading it. One was not, and `main` went red.
- A discarded `[[nodiscard]]`/`warn_unused_result` value is a build **error** (`-Werror=unused-result`). To deliberately ignore one, write `(void)call();` with a comment saying why losing that failure is tolerable — never a bare call, never a file-wide suppression. Note the compiler only enforces this for *annotated* APIs: it caught a dropped `SecRandomCopyBytes` (Apple annotates it) and said nothing about the identical dropped `RAND_bytes` (OpenSSL doesn't) — so check unannotated results yourself.

### QML
- Files: `PascalCase.qml` — new QML files **must** be added to `CMakeLists.txt` (in the `qt_add_qml_module` file list) to be included in the Qt resource system. Without this, the file won't be found at runtime.
- **New layout widgets** require registration in 3 places: (1) `CMakeLists.txt` file list, (2) `LayoutItemDelegate.qml` switch, (3) the widget catalog table (`widgetCatalogTable()` in `settings_network.cpp`) — the in-app palette, chip labels, library card, and web editor all derive from that one table. Optionally add to `LayoutCenterZone.qml` if the widget should be allowed in center/idle zones. If the widget has per-instance options, also declare its option keys (and non-text display-mode default, if any) in the readout capability schema (`readoutOptionSchema()` / `displayModeDefaults()` in the same file) — the gear indicator, the unified `ReadoutOptionsPopup`, and the web editor's option forms all derive from it. A non-text display default additionally requires the widget's item component to call `defaultDisplayModeForType()` (item components otherwise hard-code the "text" default).
- **Gesture overrides on built-in widgets** (`layout-widget-gesture-overrides`): the ten action widgets accept per-instance `longPressAction` / `doubleclickAction`. Two things are declared ONCE and derived everywhere: the option keys in `readoutOptionSchema()`, and the reserved destination in `gestureReservedDestination()` — the navigate action a widget's page is reached by, empty for widgets whose TAP opens their page. Dispatch for every widget and both render formats goes through the `LayoutActions` singleton (`runGestureOrReserved`), never a per-widget copy; `CustomItem` delegates to it too. A stored `"none"` is an explicit silence, distinct from unset. `tst_customwidgethtml` gates all of this: destinations declared once, every widget routing through the helper, and `supportDoubleClick` unconditional.
- **New Custom-widget actions** go in `layoutActionTable()` in `settings_network.cpp` — one row, `{id, labelKey, label, contexts}` — plus the dispatch arm in `CustomItem.executeActionString()`. Both editors (the in-app action picker and the web layout editor) derive from that table; neither carries a list. They used to carry one each, and the copies drifted sixteen entries apart with nothing failing, which is what `tst_customwidgethtml`'s `neitherEditorHardCodesItsOwnActionList` now prevents. A catalog row with no dispatch arm is a button that does nothing — `everyCatalogActionHasADispatchArm` catches that. `inPicker=false` marks a legacy id that still needs a label but is not offered.
- IDs/properties: `camelCase`
- Use `Theme.qml` singleton for all styling — never hardcode colors, font sizes, spacing, or radii. Use `Theme.textColor`, `Theme.bodyFont`, `Theme.subtitleFont`, `Theme.spacingMedium`, `Theme.cardRadius`, etc.
- All user-visible text must be internationalized. Use `TranslationManager.translate("section.key", "Fallback text")` for property bindings and inline expressions. Use the `Tr` component for standalone visible text (`Tr { key: "section.name"; fallback: "English text" }`). For text used in properties via `Tr`, use a hidden instance: `Tr { id: trMyLabel; key: "my.key"; fallback: "Label"; visible: false }` then `text: trMyLabel.text`. Reuse existing keys like `common.button.ok` and `common.accessibility.dismissDialog` where applicable.
  - **A binding over `translate()` re-evaluates on a language change, and the plain call above is all you need.** This is worth stating because it was NOT always true: `translate` used to be a `Q_INVOKABLE`, a binding calling it recorded no dependency, and 3,248 call sites written exactly as documented here froze on whatever language was active when the page was built. It is now a `Q_PROPERTY` holding a callable, so reading `TranslationManager.translate` establishes the dependency — see `translationmanager.h`.
  - Do **not** add a `var _ = TranslationManager.translationVersion` line to new code. It is redundant now; `Tr.qml` keeps one only as a historical marker. If you find yourself reaching for it because text is stale, the mechanism is broken — `tests/tst_translationreactivity.cpp` should be failing, and that is the thing to fix.
- Use `StyledTextField` instead of `TextField` to avoid Material floating label
- `ActionButton` dims icon (50% opacity) and text (secondary color) when disabled

### Using emoji well

The app ships the complete Twemoji set (~4,000 SVGs, MIT), resolved locally. **Reach for emoji
where they make a screen easier to scan** — but never as the only carrier of meaning, never more
than one per label, and never in place of a themed SVG for toolbar/navigation chrome. Full
guidance on where they earn their place (and where they do not) is in
`docs/CLAUDE_MD/EMOJI_SYSTEM.md`.

**The one rule that is not stylistic:** render through `Theme.emojiToImage()` (for an `Image`) or
`Theme.replaceEmojiWithImg()` (for text with emoji inline). An emoji in a plain `Text` lets a
colour glyph reach the platform renderer, which **crashes the render thread on macOS**.

### QML Gotchas (one-liners — full samples in `docs/CLAUDE_MD/QML_GOTCHAS.md`)

- **Exposing a C++ type or object to QML is a macro in a header, never `setContextProperty()` and
  never a runtime `qmlRegisterType<>()`.** Both are invisible to qmllint, `qmlcachegen` and the
  language server, and a context property is indistinguishable from a typo — the #1661 defect
  class. The table of which macro to use, the two mechanical traps (include directory,
  `qt_add_qml_module` `DEPENDENCIES`) and how to read the gate are in `QML_GOTCHAS.md`.
- **A qmllint count going UP after a fix is usually the fix working** — resolving a type lets the
  linter reach expressions it previously abandoned. Diff the per-file and per-category sets
  before calling it a regression; totals alone mislead. Likewise, many `Member "x" not found on
  type "QObject"` means an erased pointer type in C++, not a mistake in the QML.

- **Never directory-import a type the module already provides.** `import Decenza` covers every file
  in `QML_FILES`; an extra `import "../components"` re-resolves the same files as plain component
  types and **shadows the singleton registration**, so `DrinkType.shortLabel` and
  `SettingsTabs.indexOf` read as missing members while being plainly declared. 106 were deleted.
- **A page never touches `pageStack` or main.qml's `root`.** It emits an `AppShell` signal and the
  shell decides. Navigation policy: replace when the MACHINE drove the change, push when the USER
  did. See `QML_NAVIGATION.md`. Status-bar widgets are tappable from their own destination, so a
  destination pushes through `pushUnlessCurrent()` rather than `pageStack.push()` directly.
- **A registered singleton with no instance is TRUTHY, not `undefined`.** `typeof X !== "undefined"
  && X` passes and the first member call throws. Qt builds the type wrapper whether or not
  `singletonInstance()` returned anything; only the member read degrades to `undefined`. Guard the
  member (`X.doThing !== undefined`) or the platform, never the name. Full sources in
  `QML_GOTCHAS.md`.
- **`pragma ComponentBehavior: Bound` breaks delegates that take injected model roles**, at runtime
  and silently. Check for `Repeater`/`delegate:` first; with none, the pragma alone is safe. With
  delegates, add `required property` to each in the same edit.
  - **The same break comes from ONE `required property` anywhere on a delegate — no pragma
    involved.** A delegate with any required property stops receiving model roles as context
    properties, so bare `modelData` / `index` / `model` go `undefined` everywhere in it,
    including nested scopes. Adding a required property to a delegate's **base type** does it
    too, at a distance: making `RepeaterDelegateItem.itemIndex` required broke `modelData` in
    three delegates in other files that had never declared a required property themselves.
    Declare every role the delegate reads, in the same edit.
  - Neither failure is visible to the compiler, to qmllint, or to the test suite — the symptom
    is `ReferenceError: modelData is not defined` in the running app. If you touch a delegate
    or its base type, open the screen.
- **When qualifying identifiers, go by qmllint's line and column, never by text search.** One name
  can be several things in a file (a function-local `var step` and a nested `property var step`),
  and only the flagged occurrences may move.
- **A nested event loop reachable from a QML signal handler is a crash, not a slowdown.**
  `processEvents()` / `exec()` below a handler delivers queued events, and one that destroys an
  object whose handler is still running makes Qt `qFatal()`
  (`qtdeclarative/src/qml/qml/qqmlengine.cpp:1370-1396`) — shipped iOS 2.0.0 aborted this way
  (#1692). Long work goes on a worker thread with results posted back queued, never pumped inline;
  a progress bar is not a reason to pump. Which posted event did it is NOT established, and the
  obvious guess (a `DeferredDelete`) is gated — see `QML_GOTCHAS.md` for the sources.
- **Font property conflict**: don't mix `font: Theme.bodyFont` with `font.bold: true` — assign sub-properties individually.
- **Reserved names in JS model data**: `name`, `parent`, `children`, `data`, `state`, `enabled`, `visible`, `width`, `height`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `focus`, `clip` collide with QML properties — use `label` etc.
- **IME last-word drop**: call `Keyboard.commit()` before reading any `TextField.text` from a button handler — otherwise the in-progress word is lost on mobile. (`Keyboard` is a compile-time singleton, `src/core/keyboard.h`. It replaced `Qt.inputMethod`, which qmllint types as a bare `QObject` — so a typo in the call was uncheckable, and its failure mode is silent.)
- **Keyboard handling**: wrap pages with text inputs in `KeyboardAwareContainer { textFields: [...] }`.
- **FINAL Qt properties**: don't redeclare `message`/`title` etc. on `Popup`/`Dialog` (Qt 6.10+) — pick a different name like `resultMessage`.
- **Numeric defaults**: use `value ?? 0.6`, not `value || 0.6` — `||` treats `0` as falsy.
- **`native` is reserved**: use `nativeName`.
- **Emoji are encouraged; non-emoji text symbols are not.** These are two different things and only one is safe:
  - **Emoji** (`☕` `⚙️` `⚠️` `🔒`) never reach the text renderer — the app ships the complete Twemoji set (~4,000 SVGs) and every emoji is rewritten to a bundled `<img>`. Metrics are identical on every platform because it is an image, not a glyph. **Use them where they earn their place** (see "Using emoji well").
  - **Non-emoji text symbols** (`→` `←` `↗` `↕` `▶` `◀` `⧉`) are ordinary font glyphs and are now **fine to use**. Decenza Sans has only 927 glyphs and none of these, so the app also bundles **Noto Sans Math** (SIL OFL) as a symbol fallback, chained after the UI family in `Theme.fontFamilies` and on the application font. Qt consults it only for codepoints the primary lacks, so symbols come from the bundle, render identically on every platform, and stay monochrome — they take the element's colour like the text around them, which is exactly what emoji cannot do.
    - Before using a symbol not already in the app, check it: `python3 scripts/check_font_glyph_coverage.py` reads both cmaps and reports anything that would still fall through to the host. If something you want is uncovered, add a second OFL face rather than reaching for an emoji.
    - **This was previously written as an absolute ban justified by #1537. That citation does not support the ban** — #1537 dropped the "fi" ligature from "Profile", a word entirely inside the bundled font, so whatever its cause, it was not a missing glyph and cannot justify a rule about fallbacks. Nothing here has ever been traced to a missing glyph. Note that #1537's actual cause is still open: `src/main.cpp` carries two candidate explanations and states plainly that they are not reconciled — do not repeat either as settled. Kept on the record so the ban is not reinstated from memory.
    - **Still avoid a bare U+FE0F on a symbol** (`▶️` rather than `▶`). That is an explicit request for colour-emoji presentation, and in a plain `Text` — which is what `AccessibleButton.text` and most labels are — it is the macOS render-thread crash path. Adding the variation selector makes a working symbol worse, not better.
    - A symbol is still not a substitute for an **icon** in chrome. `qrc:/icons/` SVGs follow `Theme.iconColor` and scale as artwork; a glyph is text that happens to look like a picture.
  - Rule of thumb: colour picture in the emoji keyboard → emoji, fine. Line-drawing symbol in your text colour → font glyph, also fine now, but confirm coverage with the script. Toolbar/navigation affordance → neither; use a themed SVG.
- **The bundled font covers Latin (incl. Extended), Greek and Cyrillic only.** In CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari and Thai locales every glyph comes from a platform fallback, so the metric determinism the bundled font provides does **not** apply there. Layout tolerance (wrap/elide/content-driven sizing) is what keeps those UIs from clipping — never rely on a fixed width that only fits the design font.
- **`elide` is dead on `Text.RichText`**: prefer `Text.StyledText` for HTML-ish labels (elide works, and it's lighter); RichText silently disables `elide` → mid-glyph clipping.
  - **But `StyledText` cannot render CSS.** It has no `<span>` handler and never reads a `style=` attribute. The only tag whose attributes reach the character format is `<font>` (`qquickstyledtext.cpp:421-422`), and the `size` it accepts there is an HTML 1-7, not px (`:566-572`). So a `<span style="color:…; font-size:…px">` is dropped silently — text renders at the default colour and size. (`<a>`, `<img>`, `<ol>` and `<ul>` attributes *are* parsed, they just carry no styling; `<img>` is what makes `Theme.replaceEmojiWithImg` work under StyledText.) If the markup carries CSS, `Text.RichText` is the only option — and it ignores **both** `elide` and `maximumLineCount`, so bound the paint with `clip: true` and don't declare either. This is not hypothetical: it is what made the custom-widget editor's colour and S/M/L/XL rows decorative for their whole life, with the preview sharing the blindness so nothing on screen contradicted the save.
- **Measuring text in a binding**: use `FontMetrics.advanceWidth(str)`, never a mutated `TextMetrics` (`.text=`/read `.width`) — the latter self-triggers a binding loop. Mutated `TextMetrics` is only safe in an imperative Timer/handler writing a plain property. Runtime-only; a clean build won't catch it.
- **Accessibility on interactive elements**: every interactive element needs `Accessible.role`, `Accessible.name`, `Accessible.focusable: true`, and `Accessible.onPressAction`. Prefer `AccessibleButton` / `AccessibleMouseArea` over raw `Rectangle+MouseArea`. Full rules in `docs/CLAUDE_MD/ACCESSIBILITY.md`.

### MCP Tool Responses (`src/mcp/`)

MCP tool responses are consumed by LLMs which cannot reliably interpret raw numbers. Follow these conventions:

- **Never return Unix timestamps.** Use ISO 8601 with timezone: `dt.toOffsetFromUtc(dt.offsetFromUtc()).toString(Qt::ISODate)` → `"2026-03-21T11:20:41-06:00"`
- **Include units in field names.** `doseG` (grams), `pressureBar`, `temperatureC`, `flowMlPerSec`, `durationSec`, `weightG`, `targetVolumeMl`. An AI seeing `"pressure": 9.0` doesn't know bar vs PSI vs kPa.
- **Include scale in field names for bounded values.** `enjoyment0to100` instead of `enjoyment`.
- **Use human-readable strings for enums.** Machine phases, editor types, and states as strings (`"idle"`, `"pouring"`), not numeric codes.

**Adding a tool is adding to a budget, and it is enforced.** `tools/list` goes to every client on
every connection and real clients TRUNCATE it silently — ChatGPT exposed 87 of 97 tools, so two
flow-calibration tools simply did not exist for that user while a third from the same trio did.
`scripts/check_mcp_tool_budget.py` runs in the build-free per-PR job and fails on more than 80
tools, a tool description over 500 characters, a property description over 120, an inline `data:`
payload, or an estimated `tools/list` over 85 KB. Three rules follow from it:

- **A verb of an existing noun is an `action` on that tool, not a new tool.** Twelve families
  merged this way (97 → 66). Each action declares its own category and confirmation, resolved
  server-side from the ARGUMENTS and failing closed on an action it cannot resolve.
- **Declare a tier** (`McpTierCore` / `McpTierStandard` / `McpTierNiche`). Listing order is
  `(tier, name)`, so a truncating client loses the niche tail rather than an arbitrary ten.
- **Bump `McpSurfaceVersion`** (`src/mcp/mcpserver.h`) whenever the surface changes. It is
  `serverInfo.version` — the SURFACE, not the build, since 2.0.2 shipped both a 97-tool and a
  66-tool server. A version that no longer matches what the server serves is a false statement in
  the handshake, and the clients that key on it can only be correct if we are. The budget check
  fingerprints the tools and fails the PR if one moved without the other. It does not by itself
  refresh a cache a client is already holding.
- **Long-form prose goes in `resources/ai/tools/<topic>.md`**, served by `get_agent_file(topic)`
  and `decenza://tools/<topic>`. The description keeps only what picks the tool and fills its
  arguments.

Full rules, the measured payload breakdown, and the `registerActionTool` contract are in
`docs/CLAUDE_MD/MCP_SERVER.md`, which also carries the full data conventions section.

## Subsystem Pointers

- **Profiles, JSON format, stop limits, profile_sync**: `docs/CLAUDE_MD/RECIPE_PROFILES.md`
- **QML page navigation, operation pages, phase-change handler**: `docs/CLAUDE_MD/QML_NAVIGATION.md`
- **ShotServer (split files, async community endpoints, fetch rules)**: `docs/CLAUDE_MD/SHOTSERVER.md`
  - **ShotServer pages must match the app in look AND features, not look half-finished.** When a ShotServer web page mirrors an in-app screen (e.g. `/beans`, `/recipes`, `/equipment`, shot history), design it to closely match the app's clean version — same information hierarchy, card grammar, active-item highlight, empty states, and canonical page chrome (the `<header class="header">` logo + back + burger menu, the shared embedded-page style) — AND aim for feature parity: every field and action the app offers on that screen should be reachable from the web, rather than shipping a bare demo-style subset.
  - **Reuse, don't copy.** Build shared page style/shell/JS helpers instead of re-inlining per page, and reach parity features by reusing existing backends (e.g. `BeanBaseClient`, the storage classes, the patterns proven by the MCP tools and async community endpoints) rather than re-implementing them.
  - **Keep the two surfaces in sync.** When you change an in-app page that also exists in the ShotServer (or vice-versa), update the counterpart in the same change so they don't drift. Add a task for it in the change's `tasks.md`.
- **Emoji**: always `Image { source: Theme.emojiToImage(value) }` — never `Text` for emojis. See `EMOJI_SYSTEM.md` and "Using emoji well".

## Platforms

- Desktop: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Mobile: Android (API 28+), iOS (17.0+)
- Android needs Location permission for BLE scanning

## Versioning

- **Display version** (versionName): Set in `CMakeLists.txt` line 2: `project(Decenza VERSION x.y.z)`
- **Version code** (versionCode): Stored in `versioncode.txt`. Does **not** auto-increment during ordinary local builds. CI workflows bump it on tag push, and the Android workflow commits the new value back to `main`. **[barista-fork]** Opt-in exception: `./build.sh --dev` derives an ever-increasing versionCode from the wall clock (minutes since 2020-01-01 UTC) so a private daily APK installs over the last one without editing `versioncode.txt`; the file is left untouched and CI/releases (which never pass `--dev`) still read it verbatim. See `LOCAL_DEV_BUILD` in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **version.h**: Auto-generated from `src/version.h.in` with VERSION_STRING macro
- **AndroidManifest.xml**: Auto-generated from `android/AndroidManifest.xml.in` by CMake at build time (gitignored). Both `versionCode` and `versionName` come from `versioncode.txt` and `CMakeLists.txt` respectively.
- **installer/version.iss**: Auto-generated from `installer/version.iss.in` by CMake at build time (gitignored).
- To release a new version: Update VERSION in CMakeLists.txt, commit, then follow the "Publishing Releases" process in `docs/CLAUDE_MD/CI_CD.md` (create release first, then push tag)

## Git Workflow

- **Standard merge: squash + delete branch.** Every PR lands on `main` as a single squashed commit, and the feature branch is deleted on the remote (and locally if you're on it). The `merge-pr` skill (`.claude/skills/merge-pr/SKILL.md`) automates this — invoke it via `/merge-pr` or whenever the user says "merge". Equivalent CLI: `gh pr merge <num> --repo Kulitorum/Decenza --squash --delete-branch`. Do not use `--merge` (true merge commit) or `--rebase` unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- **Version codes are managed by CI** — local builds use `versioncode.txt` as-is (no auto-increment). All 6 CI workflows bump the code identically on tag push. The Android workflow commits the bumped value back to `main`.
- You do **not** need to manually commit version code files — only `versioncode.txt` is tracked. `android/AndroidManifest.xml` and `installer/version.iss` are generated from `.in` templates by CMake at build time and are gitignored.
