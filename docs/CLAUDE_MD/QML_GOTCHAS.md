# QML Gotchas

Bug-prone QML patterns discovered the hard way. The corresponding one-liners in `CLAUDE.md` point here for the full code samples and rationale.

## Font property conflict

Cannot use `font: Theme.bodyFont` and then override sub-properties like `font.bold: true`. QML treats this as assigning the property twice.

```qml
// BAD - causes "Property has already been assigned a value" error
Text {
    font: Theme.bodyFont
    font.bold: true  // Error!
}

// GOOD - use individual properties
Text {
    font.family: Theme.bodyFont.family
    font.pixelSize: Theme.bodyFont.pixelSize
    font.bold: true
}
```

## Reserved property names in JS model data

`name` is a reserved QML property (`QObject::objectName`). When a JS array of objects is used as a Repeater model, `modelData.name` resolves to the QML object name (empty string), not the JS property. Use a different key like `label`.

```qml
// BAD - modelData.name resolves to empty string
readonly property var items: [{ name: "Foo" }]
Repeater {
    model: items
    delegate: Text { text: modelData.name }  // Shows nothing!
}

// GOOD - use a non-reserved key
readonly property var items: [{ label: "Foo" }]
Repeater {
    model: items
    delegate: Text { text: modelData.label }  // Works correctly
}
```

Other reserved names to avoid in model data: `parent`, `children`, `data`, `state`, `enabled`, `visible`, `width`, `height`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `focus`, `clip`.

## IME last-word drop on mobile

On Android/iOS virtual keyboards, the last typed word is held in a composing/pre-edit state and is NOT reflected in `TextField.text` until committed. When a button's `onClicked` reads a text field's `.text` directly (to send, save, or pass to a C++ method), always call `Qt.inputMethod.commit()` first — otherwise the last word is silently dropped. This is a no-op on desktop so it is safe to always include.

```qml
// BAD - last word may be missing on mobile
onClicked: {
    doSomething(myField.text)
}

// GOOD - commit pending IME composition first
onClicked: {
    Qt.inputMethod.commit()
    doSomething(myField.text)
}
```

This applies to every button/action that reads and immediately uses text input — save dialogs, send buttons, preset name dialogs, TOTP code fields, search/import fields, etc. For `doSave()` helper functions called from both buttons and `Keys.onReturnPressed`, put the commit at the top of the function.

## Keyboard handling for text inputs

Always wrap pages with text input fields in `KeyboardAwareContainer` to shift content above the keyboard on mobile:

```qml
KeyboardAwareContainer {
    id: keyboardContainer
    anchors.fill: parent
    textFields: [myTextField1, myTextField2]  // Register all text inputs

    // Your page content here
    ColumnLayout {
        StyledTextField { id: myTextField1 }
        StyledTextField { id: myTextField2 }
    }
}
```

## FINAL properties on Qt types

Never override FINAL properties on Qt types. Qt 6.10+ marks some `Popup`/`Dialog` properties as FINAL (e.g., `message`, `title`). Declaring `property string message` on a Dialog will prevent the component from loading. Use a different name (e.g., `resultMessage`), or use the inherited property directly if it already exists on the base type.

## `elide` is silently ignored on `Text.RichText` — use `Text.StyledText`

Qt applies `elide` to `Text.PlainText` and `Text.StyledText`, but **not `Text.RichText`** (a `QTextDocument`-backed format). A label with `textFormat: Text.RichText` and `elide: Text.ElideRight` does not truncate — it overruns its width and hard-clips mid-glyph with no ellipsis, which shows up on wider/fallback system fonts (issue #1469). Default to `Text.StyledText` for any HTML-ish label; it supports the tags we use (`<b> <i> <font color> <a href> <img> <br>`) and is lighter than RichText. Reserve `Text.RichText` for the rare label that genuinely needs `QTextDocument`-only features (tables, CSS blocks) — we currently have none. For inline emoji, `Theme.replaceEmojiWithImg` emits `<img align="middle">`, which StyledText honors (it ignores the CSS `style=` attribute). `TextEdit.RichText` (editable fields) is unaffected — this is about read-only `Text`.

## Numeric defaults with `??` not `||`

JavaScript `||` treats `0` as falsy, so `value || 0.6` returns `0.6` when `value` is `0`. Use `value ?? 0.6` (nullish coalescing) which only falls back for `null`/`undefined`. Only use `||` when `0` genuinely means "no data" (e.g., unrated enjoyment, unmeasured TDS).

## `native` is reserved

`native` is a reserved JavaScript keyword — use `nativeName` instead.

## Unicode symbols in text — covered by a bundled fallback font

Decenza Sans carries 927 glyphs: Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and no symbols at all. Arrows and
geometric shapes written in QML used to be resolved by whatever the host offered, which is why the
same screen could measure differently on two machines. The app now bundles **Noto Sans Math**
(SIL OFL, `resources/fonts/NotoSansMath-Regular.ttf`) purely as a symbol fallback:

- Chained after the UI family in `Theme.fontFamilies`, used by all eight font roles, and set on the
  application font in `main.cpp` so elements that specify only `font.pixelSize` inherit it too.
- Qt consults a later family ONLY for codepoints the earlier one lacks, so letterforms are
  unchanged — Decenza Sans still draws all the text.
- It is a text font, so symbols stay monochrome and take the element's colour. That is the property
  emoji lack, and the reason symbols here are not emoji.

So `→ ← ↗ ↕ ▶ ◀ ⧉` are fine to use. Before introducing a symbol the app does not already use, run
`python3 scripts/check_font_glyph_coverage.py`: it reads both cmaps and reports anything still
falling through to the host. Add another OFL face if needed rather than reaching for an emoji.

Use the script rather than grepping for symbols you happen to think of. Hand-grepping for `→` found
one glyph type; the scan found several more, including `↗`, `⧉`, and the `▶`/`◀` that
are the entire visible content of FlowCalibrationPage's prev/next buttons. It also correctly leaves
`AddLanguagePage`'s native language names alone — those are *supposed* to use a platform fallback.

**Two things that are still wrong:**

- **A bare U+FE0F on a symbol** (`▶️` instead of `▶`) explicitly requests colour-emoji presentation.
  In a plain `Text` — which is what `AccessibleButton.text` and most labels are — that is the macOS
  render-thread crash below. The variation selector makes a working symbol worse.
- **A glyph is not an icon.** For toolbar and navigation affordances use an SVG from `qrc:/icons/`
  with `Image` (buttons: a `Row { Image {} Text {} }` contentItem). Those follow `Theme.iconColor`
  and scale as artwork; a symbol is text that happens to look like a picture.

**On #1537.** This section previously banned symbols outright and cited #1537 as the bug class. The
citation does not support the ban: #1537 dropped the "fi" ligature from "Profile", a word entirely
inside the bundled font, so whatever caused it, it was not a missing glyph and says nothing about
fallbacks. Nothing in this app has been traced to a missing glyph. Recorded so the ban is not
reinstated from memory.

Do not go further than that and state what #1537 *was*. `src/main.cpp` carries two candidate
explanations — a bundled-font family-name collision with a host copy of Roboto making family
lookup ambiguous, and distance-field re-caching during resize — and says in as many words that they
are not reconciled.

Two earlier drafts of this very paragraph got that wrong in two different ways: the first asserted
the distance-field theory as settled fact, and the second described the other hypothesis as a
"race", which is a mechanism main.cpp never mentions. Both are the same move that produced the
wrong citation this paragraph exists to correct. Read main.cpp before restating it.

**Emoji are a different case and are encouraged.** `☕`/`⚠️`/`🔒` never reach the text renderer: the app ships the complete Twemoji set and rewrites every emoji to a bundled `<img>`, so metrics are identical everywhere. Render them through `Theme.emojiToImage()` or `Theme.replaceEmojiWithImg()` — putting one in a plain `Text` lets a colour glyph reach the platform renderer and **crashes the render thread on macOS**. See "Using emoji well" in CLAUDE.md.

## Calling a Q_INVOKABLE in a binding — the binding never re-evaluates

A QML binding re-evaluates when a NOTIFY fires for a **property it read** during its last evaluation. Calling a `Q_INVOKABLE` registers no dependency, so the binding computes once and then freezes — while still returning the correct value if you call it directly, which is why this survives review and unit tests alike. It only shows up when the underlying state changes.

This has bitten this codebase repeatedly: `effectiveFontSizes` (converted to a property), `translate` (3,248 stale call sites — the language-switch bug; now a property holding a callable), and `canAutoTranslate` — which is **still a `Q_INVOKABLE`**, worked around at its call site rather than converted, so don't cite it as an example of the fix.

```qml
// BROKEN — computes once, never updates
text: TranslationManager.translate("k", "fallback")   // if translate() is a Q_INVOKABLE

// WORKS — expose the value as a property instead
Q_PROPERTY(QVariantMap effectiveFontSizes READ effectiveFontSizes NOTIFY customFontSizesChanged)

// WORKS — a property whose value is a CALLABLE keeps the call-site syntax identical
Q_PROPERTY(QJSValue translate READ translateFn NOTIFY translationsChanged)
```

The third form is how `TranslationManager` fixed 3,248 bindings without editing any of them: reading `TranslationManager.translate` is a property read, and the returned function is then invoked.

An invokable **can** work if the same expression also reads a notifying property (`Tr.qml` reads `translationVersion` first), but relying on that is a trap — a later edit removing the "unused" read silently breaks it.

**Non-reactive is sometimes correct.** `EmojiAssets.has()` is an invokable on purpose: the bundled asset set is fixed at build time, so there is nothing to re-evaluate for. Say so in a comment when you do this, or the next reader will assume it is the bug.

## Translucent element renders opaque (scene-graph opaque batch)

A `Rectangle` with a translucent color (e.g. a `Theme.scrimColor(...)` fill at alpha 0.4) can render **fully opaque** — the wallpaper behind it doesn't show through — even though the computed color is correct. Qt Quick's renderer mis-sorts it into the *opaque* batch and drops its alpha. This is platform-independent (seen on Metal/macOS, and reported on Android), so it is **not** an RHI-backend bug.

Symptom seen in practice: the in-page bottom bars and the compact preset-pill popups painted as solid colored slabs over a custom background image, while the top `StatusBar` (a sibling of the StackView pages, composited over the already-rendered page) and elements that overlap other content (the cards, the center preset pills) blended correctly. The exact scene-graph batch-sort trigger was **not** fully pinned down — treat the diagnosis as empirical: if a translucent surface renders opaque over the background, reach for the fix below rather than assuming a specific geometric cause. In particular, being flush against a window edge is *not* the deciding factor — `StatusBar` is edge-flush and blends fine.

What does **not** fix it: a translucent material color alone, or `layer.enabled` (its composite lands at the same spot and hits the same mis-sort).

What **does** fix it: give the item an `opacity < 1`, which inserts a `QSGOpacityNode` and forces the subtree through the alpha pass. The exact value only needs to be just under 1 — `0.99` is visually imperceptible but still trips the alpha pass; don't let a "cleanup" round it back to `1.0`.

```qml
// BAD - flush against the window edge / alone over the background => renders opaque
Rectangle {
    color: Theme.scrimColor(Theme.surfaceColor)   // alpha 0.4, but paints as 1.0
}

// GOOD - opacity node forces the alpha pass; scope it to when the scrim is active
Rectangle {
    color: Settings.theme.backgroundImagePath.length > 0
           ? Theme.scrimColor(Theme.surfaceColor)
           : Theme.surfaceColor
    opacity: Settings.theme.backgroundImagePath.length > 0 ? 0.99 : 1.0
}
```

## Measuring text in a binding — `FontMetrics.advanceWidth()`, never a mutated `TextMetrics`

To measure a string's width, the obvious reach is `TextMetrics`: set `.text`, read `.width`. Inside a **reactive binding** that is a self-triggering loop. Reading `.width` registers it as a dependency of the binding; assigning `.text` in the same binding invalidates `.width`; the invalidation re-runs the binding, which re-assigns `.text` — forever. Qt reports `WARN … Binding loop detected for property "<name>"`, and the property never settles. Sharing one `TextMetrics` across several bindings makes it worse: each binding's `.text` write re-triggers every other binding that reads `.width`.

Use `FontMetrics.advanceWidth(str)` instead — a pure function that reads only the (static) font and mutates nothing, so it registers no self-dependency.

```qml
// BROKEN — mutates .text and reads .width in the same binding => binding loop
TextMetrics { id: tm; font.pixelSize: Theme.scaled(16); font.bold: true }
readonly property var pageSizes: {
    var w = []
    for (var i = 0; i < items.length; ++i) {
        tm.text = items[i].name          // invalidates tm.width...
        w.push(tm.width + Theme.scaled(40))  // ...which this binding depends on => loop
    }
    return packPages(w, availWidth)
}

// WORKS — advanceWidth() is a pure call, no mutated-property dependency
FontMetrics { id: fm; font.pixelSize: Theme.scaled(16); font.bold: true }
readonly property var pageSizes: {
    var w = []
    for (var i = 0; i < items.length; ++i)
        w.push(fm.advanceWidth(items[i].name) + Theme.scaled(40))
    return packPages(w, availWidth)
}
```

The mutated-`TextMetrics` form is only safe when the measurement runs **imperatively** — inside a Timer/handler that writes a plain (non-`readonly`) property — not inside a binding. That is exactly what `PresetPillRow.measureTextWidth()` does (called from the timer-driven `calculateRows()`), which is why it never loops. Binding loops are **runtime-only**: a clean C++/qmlcache build will not catch them — check the running app's log (`debug_get_log`) after the change. (Bitten during `descriptive-recipe-names` computing idle pill-row page sizes; the shared `FontMetrics` is the font-mirroring measurement in `PillFit.js`'s callers.)
