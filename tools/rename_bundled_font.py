"""Rename the bundled UI font's family from Roboto to Decenza Sans.

WHY: registering a bundled font under a widely-distributed family name makes
family-name lookup ambiguous. Windows machines commonly have a Roboto installed
by Chrome/Adobe; when two fonts claim "Roboto", shaping and rasterization can
resolve to different files -- producing a wrong glyph for a ligature ("Profile"
rendering as "Proule") and advance widths that are not ours (#1537, #1469).
A family name nothing else can claim removes the ambiguity structurally.

Preserves the existing family SHAPE exactly -- Regular/Bold stay a RIBBI pair
(ID1 shared, ID2 = Regular/Bold); Light/Medium stay separate families linked by
typographic family (ID16/ID17), which is how Google ships them. Only the names
change, never the structure, so font selection behaves exactly as before.

Name IDs rewritten: 1 (Family), 3 (Unique ID), 4 (Full name), 6 (PostScript),
16 (Typographic Family). ID2/ID17 (subfamily) are left alone -- they carry the
weight, not the family.

Usage:  python3 tools/rename_bundled_font.py             # rewrite in place
        python3 tools/rename_bundled_font.py --dry-run   # show what WOULD change
        python3 tools/rename_bundled_font.py --verify    # assert the rename landed

NOTE on --dry-run vs --verify: --dry-run reports pending changes, so on already-renamed
fonts it prints "0 records would change" — which looks like success but proves nothing.
--verify asserts the NEW family names are actually present and exits non-zero if not.

Requires fonttools (pip install fonttools). Re-run after any font update.
