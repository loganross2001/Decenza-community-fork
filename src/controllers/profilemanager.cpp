// === Profile loading ===

// Rewrite a stored profile in the canonical encoding, but only when doing so

//
// Why on load rather than in a one-time migration: the set of files is not fixed.
// A user drops profiles into the folder whenever they like — sideloaded, restored
// from a backup, synced from another device — so a pass that marks itself complete
// converts whatever happened to be present that day and ignores every later
// arrival, which is exactly the population most likely to be legacy-encoded.
//
// Why it matters at all: DatabaseBackupManager copies the profile directory
// verbatim, so a legacy-encoded file travels byte-for-byte into a backup and onto
// another device, where a stricter reader (Decaid) rejects it outright for the
// missing tank_temperature / target_volume_count_start.
//
// `filePath` empty means the profile came from ProfileStorage; the concrete file
// is resolved below.
//
// The I/O here is synchronous on the main thread, against the project rule that
// disk I/O belongs on a worker. Deliberate, and narrow: it is one read and at most
// one write of a single profile (a few KB), in a function that already does
// synchronous QFile::exists and Profile::loadFromFile on the same thread, and
// saveProfile() likewise writes synchronously straight from QML. Moving only this
// write to a worker would add a race between two loads of the same profile for no
// measurable gain. If this ever needs to change, move the whole resolve off-thread
// rather than this write alone.
