## Context

See proposal.md — Why, for the defect and the two reference implementations.

The structural facts this design has to work with:

- **Two transport families, three peripheral families.** `BleTransport` owns the DE1's `QLowEnergyController` and a command queue gated by `m_writePending`. `ScaleBleTransport` (implementations `QtScaleBleTransport` and `CoreBluetoothScaleBleTransport`) serves all 14 scale drivers *and* both DiFluid refractometers.
- **Only one of them tracks anything.** `QtScaleBleTransport::writeCharacteristic()` validates the link and calls `service->writeCharacteristic()` straight through. No in-flight flag, no completion matching, no retry, no depth accounting — and the same for `discoverServices`, `discoverCharacteristics`, `enableNotifications` and `readCharacteristic`. That asymmetry is the defect: the DE1 side knows an operation is outstanding and the scale side has no concept of one, so it cannot yield.
- **Qt's own queue is per controller.** `readWriteQueue` and `pendingJob` are instance fields of `QtBluetoothLE`, one instance per `QLowEnergyController`. The darwin backend has no cross-peripheral queue either. No backend supplies the cross-device guarantee, which is why this is unconditional rather than platform-gated.
- **Qt already bounds every operation at 3 s on Android.** `RUNNABLE_TIMEOUT = 3000` (`QtBluetoothLE.java:69`). Our `SUBSCRIBE_TIMEOUT_MS = 3000` is a second clock racing it on the same operation.
- **The failure signal we needed was already being delivered.** `handleOnDescriptorWrite` maps a non-success status to `errorCode = 3` and calls `leDescriptorWritten(...)` — the `DescriptorWriteError` that arrived at +45 ms in the captured session. The code logged it at DEBUG, dropped it, and waited out the full 3 s anyway.
- **Existing DE1 policy that must survive byte-identical.** `MAX_WRITE_RETRIES = 5` with a derivation from a 26-log corpus, `WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000`, `WRITE_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 500`, `writeUrgent`, UUID-scoped `discardQueued()`, the depth warning at 20, and the consecutive-abandonment reporting.
- **The firmware updater holds a link for long stretches**, with erase-and-wait sequences measured in seconds between GATT operations.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- One queue, one operation dispatched at a time, across every peripheral.
- Give the scale and refractometer transports the in-flight concept they lack.
- Cover service/characteristic discovery, not only reads and writes — the observed collision was a descriptor write against a peripheral in discovery. Connect is handled by backpressure instead of being queued (see below).
- Preserve the DE1's tuned queue behaviour exactly, as per-operation policy rather than queue-wide policy.
- Delete `m_de1WaitTimer` and `SUBSCRIBE_TIMEOUT_MS`. Add no timer used as a guard.

  **As shipped, three timers exist and none of them guards anything.** `m_operationTimeoutTimer` on each transport bounds how long a *platform* may sit on an operation it never answers — the shared slot is held for that whole interval, so leaving it unbounded wedges every device. The retry delay in `noteFailed()` is a backoff: it decides *when* to try again, never *whether* something finished. And a scale connect deferred on backpressure is released by the queue's `drained()` signal, not by any interval. What the rule forbids is a timer standing in for an event that exists — which is exactly what `m_de1WaitTimer` and `SUBSCRIBE_TIMEOUT_MS` were, and both are gone. The queue itself owns no clock; dispatch is a posted `QMetaObject::invokeMethod`, not a zero-interval `QTimer`.
- One code path on every platform.

**Non-Goals:**

- Not merging the two transport classes. They keep their own platform code; only the queue is shared.
- Not serializing **inbound** notifications. Notifications are deliveries, not operations; gating them would add latency directly to live shot telemetry.
- Not giving scale operations the DE1's retry budget. Their default is zero retries — today's behaviour.
- Not changing the DE1 BLE protocol, the profile upload sequence, or any characteristic's meaning.
- No user-facing setting, diagnostic mode, or way to disable the queue.

## Decisions

### One queue, not a token above two queues

A `BleGattQueue` owns the single operation queue and the in-flight slot. `BleTransport::m_commandQueue` and `m_commandTimer` are deleted; both transport families submit to the shared queue.

*Alternative — keep both queues and gate dispatch with a shared token:* rejected after reading the code. The scale transport has no completion tracking at all, so the token version still has to teach it which platform signal ends which operation — which is most of a queue entry. Having built that, two queues leave ordering decided in three places (each local queue, plus the token) for no gain.

*Alternative — merge the two transport classes outright:* larger, and not required. The queue is the shared part; the platform code is not.

### Per-operation policy, not per-queue policy

Each queued operation carries its own retry budget, pacing and discard key. DE1 operations carry the existing constants unchanged. Scale and refractometer operations default to zero retries.

This is the load-bearing constraint of the whole change. A shared queue with one retry policy would either dilute the DE1's tuned budget or impose it on scales — and the second is actively harmful: a dead scale link would hold the shared slot through the DE1's ~32 s worst-case retry sequence, starving the machine the budget exists to protect.

### Dispatch is driven by the operation's terminal outcome, with no queue-owned clock

The next operation is dispatched when the current one reaches a terminal outcome: its success callback or its error callback. The queue owns no timer.

Where the platform can deliver neither — Android's `handleOnDescriptorWrite` explicitly discards a reply that arrives after Qt's own 3 s timeout, notifying nothing — the release is driven by the requesting transport's existing terminal machinery (`WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS` for writes, `CONNECT_WATCHDOG_MS` for connects). Those already exist, and both verify real state before acting rather than assuming from elapsed time. Adding a queue-owned bound alongside them would recreate the two-clocks-racing condition that produced the 3 s stalls.

### CCCD writes go through the queue like any other operation; `SUBSCRIBE_TIMEOUT_MS` is deleted

`subscribeNext()` currently bypasses the command queue and runs its own timer. Instead it submits a descriptor write, the error is handled when it arrives (+45 ms, not +3000 ms), retry is the queue's bounded retry, and exhaustion produces `noteWriteAbandoned()` → `writeAbandoned` → `de1LinkFault` → failed connect.

Routing it through `de1LinkFault` also closes a gap that would otherwise remain: `evaluateBleWedge()` requires a fault to have fired **and** the scale to be disconnected, so a DE1 stuck mid-subscribe with a scale connected is caught by nothing today.

*Alternative — de1app's unbounded retry:* its own source says retrying a forever-failing vital command "kind of kills the BLE abilities of the app", and it pins the command at the head of a stalled queue. What actually protects de1app is that it issues its enables three separate times during connection setup — redundancy, not error handling.

### Gating a connect: backpressure, not device state

A BLE connect is deliberately **not** a queued operation, so something else has to keep
it off a busy radio. That something is de1app's rule, which we could not use before
because there was no shared queue to measure: `ble_connect_to_scale` defers while the
shared command stack is backed up — "Too much backpressure, waiting with the connect"
(`bluetooth.tcl:2276`) — rather than while any particular device is busy.

It gates on the contention itself, so it needs no belief about *which* device is
contending. Three consequences, all wanted:

- **No DE1 present is no wait at all.** The queue is empty, so the scale connects
  immediately. This matters more than it looks: the absent-DE1 case cannot be measured
  from any capture available (only 4 of 29 carry DE1 controller states, and one supplies
  100% of the failure samples), so the gate has to be safe there by construction.
- **No device coupling.** `m_de1Connecting`, the main.cpp wiring and the DE1-state
  branch all stop being control flow.
- **No threshold and no interval.** de1app polls with `after 1000` and uses a depth of
  >2 because a poll cannot express "when it is clear". `drained()` is that event
  exactly, so both numbers disappear rather than being imported.

*Alternative — queue the connects too:* rejected, and it is the strongest alternative.
It would make the gate and the queue one mechanism and order connects against GATT
traffic in both directions. But a scale reconnect mid-shot would then stall DE1 writes
for the duration of that connect, and stop-at-weight is on that path. de1app's
asymmetry is deliberate and right: a connect waits for GATT traffic, GATT traffic never
waits for a connect.

*Alternative — gate on the DE1's connection state:* shipped briefly and withdrawn. It
enforced an inherited claim — that two concurrent GATT connects collide on the Android
stack — that no available log supports. In the one capture carrying both DE1 controller
states and scale connects, scale connects fail 101 of 101 times when no DE1 is up at
all, so its 2-of-6 success rate during a DE1 connect says nothing about the DE1. The
state now only records, and feeds a radio-context line on every scale connect so the
claim becomes answerable from a submitted log instead of being enforced on faith.

### Ordering is FIFO with no per-device priority

Served in submission order regardless of peripheral. No DE1 priority.

*Alternative — prioritise the DE1:* rejected. Priority produces starvation, and the problem was concurrency, not ordering. If a starvation case appears, it can be argued on its own evidence.

### Per-operation granularity, not per-phase

The slot is held around each individual operation, not across a whole connect-and-subscribe phase. Phase granularity would have fixed the observed session but leaves steady-state operations racing — a DE1 MMR keepalive and a scale tare issued in the same moment collide identically, with no phase boundary to catch it. It also avoids stalling every peripheral for the duration of a firmware update: the updater holds the slot per operation and releases it across its waits.

### Dispatch the next operation posted, never synchronously from the release

Releasing must not call straight into the next requester on the same stack. A completion handler that releases and immediately re-enters would let a device recurse into its own next operation beneath its own callback — the same re-entrancy class that makes a nested event loop under a QML handler fatal. The next dispatch is posted.

### Delete `m_de1WaitTimer` rather than lengthen it

The 15 s cap is a timer used as a guard, and it covers one of three orderings. Its stated purpose — do not wait forever when no DE1 is present — is already an event: discovery failure, no-device-found, or the existing `CONNECT_WATCHDOG_MS` abort. `setServiceDiscoveryActive()` (the DE1's advisory "peer scales please pause") is subsumed and removed with it.

### The subscribe sequencer collapses into the queue

`subscribeAll()`/`subscribeNext()` is a sequencer in its own right: `m_pendingSubscribeQueue`, `m_currentSubscribeUuid`, a 3 s timeout, and late-ACK matching in `onDescriptorWritten` so a reply for an already-abandoned characteristic cannot advance the chain. Every one of those exists because there was no shared queue to sequence against.

Ported naively it becomes a sequencer running inside a sequencer, which is worse than either. Ported properly it is a loop: submit one operation per stream, then the initial reads, then a final marker operation that baselines the liveness clock and emits `connected()`. FIFO ordering supplies what the recursion used to, and all five of those members and the ACK matcher are deleted.

It also removes a flag that would otherwise have to be invented. A required stream whose retries are exhausted calls `forget(this)`, which drops that requester's remaining queued work — including the completion marker — so "do not report connected" needs no `m_subscribeFailed` bool. The teardown path already says it.

### Two latent defects the migration exposes, both fixes in their own right

- **`characteristicRead` and `characteristicChanged` share one handler.** Under a queue, releasing the slot on an unsolicited notification would free an unrelated write still in the air. They must be separated regardless of this change; today the conflation is merely invisible.
- **Three early returns in `writeCharacteristic()` bail without touching the platform.** Nothing will ever complete for them. Today that is harmless; under a queue each one wedges every device until something else forces a teardown. Every path that does not reach the platform must release the slot.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **This touches the most carefully tuned code in the BLE layer.** The DE1 write path's retry budget, pacing, urgent path and discard semantics all move. → They must come through byte-identical, and the tests that pin them are load-bearing rather than confirmatory. Pin the current behaviour in tests *before* moving it, so the move is verified against a recorded baseline rather than against a reading of the code.
- **Scale operations gain queueing they never had.** A scale op that never completes now holds the slot where previously it was fire-and-forget. → Zero-retry default plus release-on-teardown keeps the exposure to a single operation, and a disconnecting transport frees the slot immediately.
- **A wedged queue stalls every device, not one.** Concentrating the mechanism concentrates the failure. → This is why release-on-teardown and release-on-error are requirements rather than nice-to-haves, and why an operation released without success is reported as failed rather than assumed successful.
- **Throughput cost on multi-write sequences.** A profile upload is ~20 writes; with a scale connected they now interleave. → The old 50 ms pacing was NOT carried across, so an upload is if anything faster than before: that constant was armed on an enqueue that found the link idle, delaying the first write after a pause while consecutive writes went unpaced. What bounds the link now is that nothing is issued while anything is outstanding. Measure an upload with a scale connected before and after and report the delta rather than asserting no regression.
- **Interleaving during a profile upload.** The DE1 firmware's receive state machine is wedged by a *disconnect* mid-upload, not by delay. → Other peripherals' operations do not disconnect the DE1, and per-device ordering is preserved. Still: exercise an upload with a scale actively connected.
- **Failing the connect on a subscribe error could loop.** A DE1 that consistently fails one CCCD write now reconnects instead of running degraded. → Intended — a machine that cannot chart or stop a shot is not usable — but the reconnect ladder's existing backoff and error surfacing must not be bypassed, and the user must not see a silent reconnect loop.
- **Behaviour change on platforms with no reported defect.** → One log is not evidence other platforms are safe; the per-controller queue is backend-independent, and a single code path is worth more than a platform-conditional optimisation. Accepted deliberately.

- **An urgent DE1 write can now wait behind ANOTHER device's operation, and stop-at-weight is on that path.** This is the one guarantee the shared queue genuinely weakens, and it is worth stating plainly rather than leaving inside the `writeUrgent` comment. Before: the DE1's `writeUrgent` bypassed the DE1's own private queue, and a scale's traffic was on a separate unserialized path that could never block it. After: `submitFront()` reorders only what is WAITING — nothing preempts an operation the platform has already accepted — so if a scale or refractometer holds the slot, the SAW stop command waits for it.

  Realistic exposure during a shot is small: the scale is connected and doing 1 Hz heartbeat writes that complete in tens of milliseconds, and inbound notifications are not queued at all. The worst case is not small: a scale that stops answering holds the slot for `OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` (5 s), and a DE1 write already mid-retry-cascade holds it for up to 32.5 s.

  **Bounded, not removed.** Reads and writes now carry `RW_TIMEOUT_MS = 3000` rather than the 5 s connect-time budget, which cuts the tail by 2 s. That constant is not a tuning knob: it is Qt's own per-job timeout on Android (`RUNNABLE_TIMEOUT`, `QtBluetoothLE.java:69`), past which Qt abandons the job and discards any late reply (`:580-589`) — so on that platform there is provably no answer coming after it, and holding the shared radio longer buys nothing anywhere. 3 s is still a ruined shot; this makes the worst case smaller, not acceptable.

  Removing the tail entirely means not having optional scale writes outstanding during a shot at all — the Decent Scale heartbeat is the only one in practice. That is a per-driver change of exactly the shape this change deleted (`setHeartbeatsPaused`), so it wants evidence before it is rebuilt under a new name.

  Deliberately NOT mitigated with preemption machinery, because the honest position is that the exposure is unmeasured rather than known-acceptable, and a priority lane is a large mechanism to build on a guess. **Task 9.7 measures SAW latency under scale contention on hardware; that measurement, not this paragraph, is what should decide whether a priority lane is justified.**

## Migration Plan

No persisted state, no schema change, no data migration. Deploy is the build; rollback is a revert.

No CI job builds a PR, so verification is local plus dispatched workflows: the full suite through Qt Creator before opening the PR, an Android test build for the platform the defect was reported on, and a macOS or iOS build to compile `corebluetoothscalebletransport.mm`, which the Android build does not.

## Open Questions

- Whether any inter-write pacing should be reintroduced now that the shared queue imposes ordering. Resolved for now as **no**: the old 50 ms constant did not do what its name said (see the throughput note above), and reintroducing it as a real per-write delay would add about a second to a ~20-write profile upload for no measured benefit.
