# Shot Review: Current State

This is a snapshot of how the post-shot review and shot detail pages work today,
focused on the quality-badge / detector system and the Shot Summary dialog that
share the same underlying analysis. It is the source of truth for anyone modifying
detectors, persistence, the badge UI, or the summary text; the `git log` for
`docs/SHOT_REVIEW.md` (and its prior name `SHOT_REVIEW_IMPROVEMENTS.md`) is the
source of truth for the path that got us here.

The detectors are still under active iteration — expect this doc to drift, and
prefer reading the code (`src/ai/shotanalysis.h` is heavily commented) when in
doubt.

## 1. What the user sees

### Pages

Both **PostShotReviewPage** (auto-opens when a shot ends) and **ShotDetailPage**
(opened from history) render the same shot data with the same components. A
shared `shotReview/advancedMode` setting toggles information density on both.

### Basic mode (default)

- Graph: pressure, flow, temperature, weight, weight flow rate.
- Goal overlays for pressure / flow / temperature (dashed).
- Phase markers (frame boundaries) without label text.
- Quality badges (one or more chips below the graph).
- Metrics: duration, dose, output, ratio, rating.
- Notes, bean / grinder info, barista.

### Advanced mode adds

- Resistance (P/F), Darcy resistance (P/F²), conductance (F²/P), dC/dt, mix
  temperature curves (toggleable in the legend).
- Phase marker label text (frame boundaries with transition reasons —
  `[W]` weight, `[P]` pressure, `[F]` flow, `[T]` time).
- Phase summary panel — collapsible per-phase metrics table.
- TDS / EY fields (review page) and analysis card + debug log button (detail
  page).

### Quality badges

Four flags, surfaced via `qml/components/QualityBadges.qml`. When any fire,
those chips show; when none fire, a single green "Clean extraction" chip
shows. A tappable "Shot Summary" chip always sits at the end of the row —
it's the entry point to the analysis dialog described in §3.

| Flag                       | Color  | Label                  | Source                       |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `pourTruncatedDetected`    | red    | "Puck failed"          | `detectPourTruncated`        |
| `channelingDetected`       | red    | "Channeling detected"  | `detectChannelingFromDerivative` |
| `grindIssueDetected`       | orange | "Grind issue"          | `detectGrindIssue` (`analyzeFlowVsGoal`) |
| `skipFirstFrameDetected`   | red    | "First step skipped"   | `detectSkipFirstFrame`       |

(A fifth flag, `temperatureUnstable`, was retired — see openspec change
`remove-temperature-unstable-badge`. The detector measured average
deviation from goal but was labeled "Temp unstable"; in practice, the
deviation it caught was profile-design intent on D-Flow / Extractamundo /
TurboBloom and 9+ other built-in profiles whose temperature gap is by
design.)

**Suppression cascade.** `pourTruncatedDetected` is dominant: when it fires,
`channelingDetected` / `grindIssueDetected` are forced to false. The
cascade is enforced in exactly one place — `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot` —
and the boolean badge columns are a deterministic projection of the
resulting `DetectorResults` struct (see §4 mapping table; helper at
`src/history/shotbadgeprojection.h`). Save-time, load-time recompute, the
dialog, the AI advisor, and MCP `shots_get_detail` all share that one
pipeline and projection. The puck failed to build pressure, so the curves
the other detectors read off don't mean what they normally mean
(conductance saturates → derivative flat, flow tracks preinfusion goal →
grind delta ≈ 0). `skipFirstFrameDetected` is **not** suppressed — it's a
machine/profile issue orthogonal to puck integrity. The clean-extraction
green chip's visibility gate also includes `!pourTruncatedDetected` so a
suppressed puck-failure shot can't fall through to the wrong all-clear.

The badges are recomputed on every shot load (see §4) so detector improvements
take effect on existing shots without a manual re-analyze.

---

## 2. Detector internals

All four detectors live in `src/ai/shotanalysis.{h,cpp}` as static methods on
`ShotAnalysis`. Tuning constants are defined at the top of the header so they
can be tweaked in one place. The header is heavily commented — read it
alongside this section.

### 2.1 Channeling

Single source of truth for channeling severity is `detectChannelingFromDerivative`,
operating on the Gaussian-smoothed conductance derivative `dC/dt`. The badge
fires on the **Sustained** severity tier; the **Transient** tier surfaces only
in the Shot Analysis dialog popup.

**Severity tiers** (`ChannelingSeverity`):

- **None** — no sample's `|dC/dt|` exceeds `CHANNELING_DC_TRANSIENT_PEAK` (5.0).
- **Transient** — a single peak above 5.0 (a self-healed channel).
- **Sustained** — more than `CHANNELING_DC_SUSTAINED_COUNT` (10) samples above
  `CHANNELING_DC_ELEVATED` (3.0) **inside the inclusion windows**.

**Inclusion windows** are built by `buildChannelingWindows`. Without windowing
the detector flags every lever-style preinfusion as channeling because the
natural pressure-rise dynamic drives `dC/dt` strongly negative. A sample is
included only when, at that time:

1. The active control goal (flow goal during flow-mode phases, pressure goal
   during pressure-mode phases) is **stationary**: `|goal(t±0.75 s) − goal(t)|
   / goal(t) ≤ 0.15` on both sides.
2. The actual value has **converged** onto the goal: `|actual − goal| / goal ≤
   0.15`.
3. Actual pressure is not rising fast in either mode: when
   `pressureNow > 0.5` bar AND `pressureFut > pressureNow * 1.15` over 0.75 s
   ahead, the sample is disqualified. Two ramp dynamics produce the same
   conductance-drop signature and are both gated here:
   - Flow-mode lever rise (Cremina, Damian LRv3, 80's Espresso preinfusion):
     flow goal stationary while the puck builds pressure under a pressure-
     ceiling exit.
   - Pressure-mode rise-and-hold final leg: pressure goal locked at target
     but actual pressure still ramping toward it. The 15 %-of-goal
     convergence check admits these samples because actual is close enough
     to goal, even though it is still climbing fast — `dC/dt` clamps at the
     negative floor as conductance drops with pressure. (Shot 889 on 80's
     Espresso was the motivating false positive.)
   Falling pressure is always allowed — bloom transitions and
   pressure-mode → flow-mode handoffs are legitimate channeling signals,
   and the dC/dt detector counts both signs of conductance change as
   diagnostic. The 0.5 bar precondition gates out the near-atmospheric
   window where small absolute jitter would otherwise read as a 15 %
   relative rise.

Contiguous qualifying times collapse into windows; gaps ≤
`WINDOW_GAP_MERGE_SEC` (0.3 s) are merged.

**Fallback semantics** are deliberate:

- Empty `phases` → emits a single whole-pour window (legacy shots predating
  phase markers run unrestricted, preserving coverage).
- Non-empty `phases` but no qualifying window → returns empty, and
  `detectChannelingFromDerivative` reports `None` (not unrestricted). This is
  the "all-ramp shot, nothing reliable to analyze" path; better to be silent
  than to false-positive.

**Pour-window trim**: the first `CHANNELING_DC_POUR_SKIP_SEC` (2.0 s) and last
`CHANNELING_DC_POUR_SKIP_END_SEC` (1.5 s) of the pour are excluded from the
detector's time grid — they cover the pressure-ramp / flow-catchup transient
at start and the natural tail acceleration at end. `buildChannelingWindows`
applies the same trim to its output bounds.

**Hard skips** (`shouldSkipChannelingCheck` returns true → `channelingDetected`
forced to false):

- Beverage type is `filter`, `pourover`, `tea`, `steam`, or `cleaning`.
- Average flow during the pour exceeds `CHANNELING_MAX_AVG_FLOW` (3.0 mL/s) —
  turbo / very-coarse shots have no diagnostic dC/dt signal.

**Profile-level skip**: a `channeling_expected` flag in `ProfileKnowledge`
(reached via `ShotSummarizer::getAnalysisFlags(profileKbId)`) suppresses
channeling detection for profiles where channeling-shaped curves are intentional.

### 2.2 Grind issue

Implemented by `detectGrindIssue`, which delegates to `analyzeFlowVsGoal` and
returns true when either arm fires. Two arms run **additively**, not as
fallback — a clean flow-mode preinfusion can hide a pressure-mode choke and
vice versa.

**Profile-context gate (Arm 1 only).** `analyzeFlowVsGoal` takes a
`bool profileKbResolved` parameter. When `false` — i.e.
`ShotSummarizer::matchProfileKey(profileTitle, profileType)` returned
empty (no exact alias hit, no #1198 longest-boundary-prefix hit, no
editor-type default hit) — Arm 1 is **skipped entirely**: the flow-mode
range builder doesn't run, `sampleCount`/`delta` stay zero, and Arm 1
contributes nothing to `hasData`. Arm 2 (choked-puck + yield-shortfall
+ yield-overshoot) still runs unconditionally — those arms read
physics-level signals (mean pressurized flow, yield ratio) that don't
depend on profile shape. The result
projects through the existing `grindCoverage="notAnalyzable"` path when
Arm 2 also has no data, or `"verified"` when it does. `skipped` stays
`false`, distinct from the `grind_check_skip` flag's `"skipped"`
coverage. Production call sites derive the bool from
`!profileKbId.isEmpty()` of the resolved id already stored on
`ShotRecord` / `ShotSaveData` / `ShotSummary`. Direct test callers
default to `profileKbResolved = true`, preserving the pre-change
contract. See openspec change `skip-grind-arm1-when-kb-unresolved` for
the rationale: Arm 1 reads the firmware-reported `flow_goal` series as
a target the puck should track, but on profiles we have no KB context
for, that series may be a safety limiter, a ramp-down command, or a
pump-ramp curve rather than a target — averaging actuals against it
produces false-positive grind diagnoses. The `grind_check_skip` flag is
still the way to opt a *known* profile family out of Arm 1 (the
`advanced-spring-lever` pattern from #1230); the new gate handles
*unknown* profiles by inferring "no opinion" from the resolver state.

**Arm 1: flow-vs-goal averaging** (the "primary" path).

For each flow-mode phase, builds an inclusive time range:

- Skip the first `GRIND_PUMP_RAMP_SKIP_SEC` (0.5 s) of the first flow-mode
  phase that coincides with `pourStart` — pump-ramp lag, not a grind signal.
- If the phase exits via `transitionReason == "pressure"` **or**
  `"pressure_unconfirmed"`, skip the trailing `GRIND_LIMITER_TAIL_SKIP_SEC`
  (1.5 s) — the firmware's pressure ceiling has engaged and the controller is
  no longer tracking flow goal. The unconfirmed variant (recorded by
  `MainController` when the exit was configured but the threshold crossing
  fell between BLE samples — see §2.3's guard for the full vocabulary) is
  usually a real limiter engagement, and the safe polarity here is to trim:
  dropping 1.5 s of maybe-clean data is harmless under the ≥ 1 s guard below,
  while including a limiter-suppressed tail biases the delta toward "too
  fine". Note this is the opposite polarity from the skip-first-frame guard,
  which must NOT trust unconfirmed reasons — the two consumers deliberately
  read the confirmed/unconfirmed split differently.
- `"flow_unconfirmed"` does **not** trigger this trim — it exists specifically
  for pressure-limiter engagement.
- Both trims are gated on the resulting range remaining ≥ 1 s long. Extreme
  puck-failure shots with sub-second flow-mode phases would otherwise have
  their entire data trimmed away.

Within those ranges, average actual flow vs. flow goal across all samples
where `goal ≥ FLOW_GOAL_MIN_AVG` (0.3 mL/s — gates out preinfusion sentinel
goals) AND `flow_goal` is approximately stationary across the sample (the
**stationarity gate**: reject when `|goal(t ± FLOW_GOAL_STATIONARY_HALF_SEC)
− goal(t)| / max(goal(t), FLOW_GOAL_MIN_AVG) > FLOW_GOAL_STATIONARY_REL`,
with the half-window at 0.75 s and the threshold at 15 %). The stationarity
gate uses the same numeric thresholds as `WINDOW_STATIONARY_REL` /
`WINDOW_HALF_SEC` in the channeling detector but **omits** the convergence
check (the channeling-detector's `|actual − goal| / goal ≤
WINDOW_CONVERGED_REL` gate has no analog in Arm 1) — both detectors share
the principle "flow_goal must be roughly flat to be meaningful", but the
channeling detector additionally requires that the actual curve has
converged on the goal.

The goal lookups intentionally use `findValueAtTime` (clamps out-of-bounds
to first/last sample) rather than `lookupOrNaN` (returns NaN out-of-bounds).
Extreme short puck-failure shots — flow-mode phases under ~1.5 s — have
legitimate flat-goal signals (puck gushed against a steady flow goal)
where the stationarity half-window extends past the series start. NaN-on-
out-of-bounds would silence those genuine gushers; clamping to the real
first/last value preserves them because the comparison is still against
the actual stationary value, not a synthetic sentinel.

Requires ≥ 5 qualifying samples to yield a result. The check fires when
`|delta| > FLOW_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD` (0.4 mL/s); positive delta = coarse,
negative = fine.

The stationarity gate was added in the issue #1128 fix (see §7) to silence
a false positive on "dynamic bloom" frames configured `pump=flow, flow=0,
exit_pressure_under` — frames where the firmware ramps the flow command
down toward zero so the puck bleeds off preinfusion pressure naturally.
The frame is `isFlowMode = true` from the firmware's perspective, but its
flow goal is a ramp-down command rather than a target the puck should
track. Flat targets (Malabar 1.88 mL/s pin, lever flow preinfusion) pass
the gate cleanly; rapid monotonic decays fail at every interior sample.

**Arm 2: choked-puck check** (pressure-mode only).

For each pressure-mode phase (or the whole pour window if all phases are
flow-mode-labeled), accumulate samples where `pressure ≥
CHOKED_PRESSURE_MIN_BAR` (4.0). Two sub-arms feed `chokedPuck` with
**split gates**:

- **Severe (flow arm)**: mean pressurized flow `< CHOKED_FLOW_MAX_MLPS` (0.5
  mL/s). Requires `flowSamples ≥ 5` AND `pressurizedDuration ≥
  CHOKED_DURATION_MIN_SEC` (15 s) — needs sustained pressure to compute a
  meaningful mean flow. Catches obvious failures (e.g., 80's Espresso with
  1.1 g yield and ~0.3 mL/s mean).
- **Moderate (yield arm)**: `finalWeightG / targetWeightG < CHOKED_YIELD_RATIO_MAX`
  (0.70 — tightened from a prior 0.85 by the 500-shot audit). Requires only
  `flowSamples ≥ 5` (puck saw meaningful pressure briefly) — does NOT
  require sustained `pressurizedDuration` because its diagnosis is
  yield-based and does not read mean pressurized flow. Catches shots like
  745 (Adaptive v2, 23 g of 36 g target = 0.64, ~8.8 s pressurized
  window).

The yield arm decouples from the 15 s flow-arm gate because they answer
different questions: the flow arm asks "did the puck deliver any flow
under sustained pressure?" (needs 15 s of pressure to average), the yield
arm asks "did the puck deliver enough yield, full stop?" (just needs to
have seen pressure briefly so we know the shot wasn't aborted before
extraction). The audit found shots that lost both gates simultaneously
because they shared the duration precondition — fix splits them. See
openspec change `tighten-grind-yield-shortfall-arm` for the rationale.

The 0.70 threshold is the empirical sweet spot from the 500-shot audit:
0.85 over-flagged Adaptive v2 fast-pour profiles delivering 71-76% of
target by design. 0.70 catches the genuine choke shapes (yields under
~70%) without false-positives on profiles whose normal yield is
intentionally below target.

The yield arm requires both `targetWeightG > 0` and `finalWeightG > 0` —
imported shots without target metadata correctly stay silent.
`finalWeightG` works on either a real BLE scale or Decenza's `FlowScale`
virtual scale (dose-aware flow integration), so the arm fires headless too.

**`hasData` and `verifiedClean` are independent signals.** `hasData = true`
fires whenever EITHER arm produced a result: the flow arm's full gates
passed (≥ 5 samples AND ≥ 15 s pressurized) regardless of whether a choke
fired, OR the yield arm fired standalone (≥ 5 pressurized samples AND
yield/target < 0.70). Either path proves the detector saw enough to speak.

`verifiedClean = true` is stricter — it requires the **flow arm's full
gates** (≥ 5 samples, ≥ 15 s pressurized at ≥ 4 bar) AND none of
`chokedPuck`, `yieldOvershoot`, or `|delta| > FLOW_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD`
fires. The 15 s gate is load-bearing here: a healthy sustained pressurized
pour is what the positive signal actually asserts. The Shot Summary dialog
emits a `[good]` line on `verifiedClean = true`, distinct from the prior
implicit "no badge fired ⇒ assume clean" behavior — without it, profiles
whose Arm 1 windows lie entirely before `pourStart` (simple two-marker
Preinfusion + Pour shapes) silently pass even when no detector saw any
data. The line text branches on `GrindCheck.sampleCount`: Arm 1 ran and
saw qualifying samples (`> 0`) ⇒ "Grind tracked goal during pour"; Arm 1
saw no samples (`== 0`, either because its windows lay outside the pour
window or because the new `profileKbResolved` gate skipped it) ⇒ "Puck
sustained healthy pressure during pour" — the honest wording when Arm 2
alone supplied the verifiedClean signal.

A shot where `hasData = true` but `verifiedClean = false` means the yield
arm fired (or, if `chokedPuck=false && yieldOvershoot=false`, the flow
arm gates passed but the verified-clean criteria didn't hold for some
other reason). Consumers wanting "verified clean" specifically must read
`grindVerifiedClean` directly, not just `hasData`.

**Coverage signal.** `DetectorResults.grindCoverage` carries one of:

- `"verified"` — `hasData=true`. The detector ran with enough data to
  produce a result. Set whether or not the result is healthy: a
  verified-clean pour AND a chokedPuck/yieldOvershoot/large-delta pour
  BOTH carry `"verified"`. Coverage signals data availability, not
  health outcome — the verdict and `grindDirection` carry the specific
  diagnosis; consumers wanting "verified clean" specifically should
  read `grindVerifiedClean` directly.
- `"notAnalyzable"` — espresso shot, non-degenerate pour window, `hasData=false`.
  Common on simple two-marker profiles (A-Flow, La Pavoni, Malabar,
  Italian Style) where Arm 1's flow-mode window lies entirely before
  `pourStart` and Arm 2's pressurized-duration gate isn't met. The dialog
  emits `[observation]` "Could not analyze grind on this profile shape — …"
  and the verdict cascade switches to "Clean shot, but grind could not be
  evaluated for this profile shape." instead of the bare "Clean shot. Puck
  held well."
- `"skipped"` — non-espresso beverage or `grind_check_skip` flag.
- `""` (empty) — pourTruncated cascade is active (the dominator already
  explains why the grind block was skipped) OR the pour window is
  degenerate (`pourEnd <= pourStart`).

**Hard skips** (`skipped = true`, both arms suppressed):

- Beverage type is `filter`, `pourover`, `tea`, `steam`, or `cleaning`.
- `analysisFlags` contains `grind_check_skip`.
- Pressure data is empty (the arm-2 path early-returns).

### 2.3 Skip first frame

`detectSkipFirstFrame` operates on phase markers only — no curves needed. Two
distinct branches inside one function, picked from the marker stream.

**Exit-condition guard (checked first).** Before either branch, if the first
non-zero frame's marker `transitionReason` is `"pressure"`, `"flow"`, or
`"weight"` (case-insensitive), the detector returns `false` — the preceding
frame exited on its own confirmed exit condition, so it executed as designed and
was not skipped. DE1 preinfusion/fill frames routinely exit far earlier than
their configured max duration (that is their purpose), and without this guard the
duration checks below flag them as "skipped." These reasons are recorded only for
a *confirmed* sensor exit. When the exit was configured but the threshold
crossing fell between BLE samples (and time had not expired), `MainController`
records `"pressure_unconfirmed"`/`"flow_unconfirmed"` instead — a hint, not
ground truth. The guard intentionally does **not** match the unconfirmed
variants: a genuinely skipped frame lands in that same unconfirmed branch, so
trusting the hint would mask the very bug this detector exists to catch.
Unconfirmed, `"time"`, and empty (old-data) reasons all fall through to the
branches. This uses the same `transitionReason` signal `analyzeFlowVsGoal`
(the grind detector, `detectGrindIssue`) reads — but with the opposite
polarity for unconfirmed values (see §2.2's limiter-tail trim), which is
deliberate: each consumer defaults to its own safe side.

**FW-bug branch** — frame 0 was never observed before a non-zero frame:
returns `phase.time < 2.0`. The 2-second window matches the de1app Tcl
plugin's polling cadence (it can only catch this before t = 2 s), so we use
the same hard window for parity. This case requires a power-cycle to fix.

**Short-first-step branch** — frame 0 was observed but ended early:
returns `phase.time < cutoff` where:

```
cutoff = (firstFrameConfiguredSeconds > 0)
       ? min(2.0, 0.5 * firstFrameConfiguredSeconds)
       : 2.0
```

The configured-aware path avoids false positives on profiles whose first
frame is configured for 2 seconds — BLE notification jitter routinely lands
the frame-1 marker a few hundred ms early, and a 1.87 s actual on a 2 s
configured frame should not flag.

`expectedFrameCount` is honored when known: values < 2 suppress detection
(no second frame to skip to), and out-of-range frame numbers are skipped as
malformed.

`firstFrameConfiguredSeconds` is fed in by callers from `ProfileFrameInfo`
(parsed from the stored profile JSON via `profileFrameInfoFromJson`).

### 2.4 Pour truncated (puck failed)

`detectPourTruncated` returns true when peak pressure inside the pour window
stays below `PRESSURE_FLOOR_BAR` (2.5). It catches the failure mode where
conductance saturates at its clamp, `dC/dt` is flat, and flow tracks the
preinfusion goal perfectly — every other detector goes silent or fires the
wrong diagnosis. Skipped for filter / pourover / tea / steam / cleaning
beverages where low pressure is expected.

**Suppression cascade.** When this detector fires, `analyzeShot` (the
single enforcement point) skips the channeling and grind blocks, leaving
those `DetectorResults` fields at their `false` defaults. The badge
projection then reads those defaults so `channelingDetected` /
`grindIssueDetected` stay `false`. See §1 for the rationale; see §4 for
the projection mapping.

**Population the badge catches.** A puck-failure shot can come from any of:
grind way too coarse, distribution failure (massive channel), no/loose
puck or missing basket, severe underdose, profile misconfigured (high
flow goal with no pressure cap), or an early abort. The user can't
discriminate among these from the curve, so the verdict text leads with
the meta-action ("Don't tune off this shot — peak pressure never built,
so the other quality signals are unreliable") rather than naming a
specific fix.

---

## 3. Shot Summary dialog

The "Shot Summary" chip at the end of the badge row opens
`qml/components/ShotAnalysisDialog.qml` — a non-AI, non-modal-blocking
analysis pane that surfaces a list of observations plus a single verdict
line. The text is computed entirely in C++ from the captured curves; the
QML side is a thin display layer.

### Pipeline

There are two consumer paths that share a single detector pass:

- **In-app dialog path** (returns prose only):
  `ShotAnalysisDialog` (visible) →
  reads `shotData.summaryLines` directly (populated by
  `convertShotRecord`'s `analyzeShot` pass). When `summaryLines` is
  absent, the dialog renders its header with no body — preferable to
  recomputation through a parallel reconstruction path. The result is
  a `QVariantList` of `{ text, type }` lines rendered by a `Repeater`
  with a colored dot per line.
- **MCP path** (returns prose + structured detectors):
  `convertShotRecord` → reads `record.cachedAnalysis` populated by
  `loadShotRecordStatic`'s earlier `analyzeShot` pass (single computation
  per detail load). Falls back to `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot(...)` inline
  only for direct-construction callers (`ShotHistoryExporter`, tests) that
  bypass `loadShotRecordStatic`. Either way the result is an
  `AnalysisResult { lines, detectors }` emitted as `summaryLines` plus a
  nested `detectorResults` JSON object on every shot record served by
  `shots_get_detail` / `shots_compare`.

Both paths run the same `analyzeShot` body. The dialog discards `detectors`;
MCP serializes the full struct. The AI advisor's prompt builder
(`ShotSummarizer::summarize` / `summarizeFromHistory`) reads its prose
lines through the `generateSummary` wrapper for the live-shot path or
directly from the pre-computed `shotData.summaryLines` for the
historical-shot path.

### Line types and rendering

Each line carries a `type`:

| Type          | Dot color                     | Used for                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `good`        | success (green)               | "Puck stable", happy-path observations     |
| `caution`     | warning (orange)              | flow drift, grind direction                |
| `warning`     | error (red)                   | sustained channeling, choked puck, frame skip, pour truncated |
| `observation` | text-secondary (neutral grey) | preinfusion drip mass / duration           |
| `verdict`     | no dot, larger font           | always exactly one, last in the list       |

The dialog renders the verdict in subtitle font with no dot to set it apart
from the observation lines.

### Observations emitted

`analyzeShot` computes `pourTruncated` first; when it fires, the
channeling / flow-trend / grind blocks below all skip
emission entirely. The list collapses to a single warning + the
puck-failed verdict. Order otherwise follows `analyzeShot`
top-to-bottom:

1. **Channeling status** — uses the same `buildChannelingWindows` +
   `detectChannelingFromDerivative` path as the badge. Emits **Sustained**
   ("warning"), **Transient** ("caution") with the spike timestamp, or a
   "Puck stable" ("good") line. Skipped for filter / pourover / tea /
   steam / cleaning beverages, turbo shots, profiles with the
   `channeling_expected` analysis flag, **and when `pourTruncated`
   fires**.
2. **Flow trend** — compares mean flow in the first 30% of the pour
   against the last 30%. ±0.5 mL/s thresholds emit "Flow rose … (puck
   erosion)" or "Flow dropped … (fines migration or clogging)" as
   "caution". Suppressed for profiles with the `flow_trend_ok` analysis
   flag (Cremina lever and similar where declining/rising flow is by
   design), **and when `pourTruncated` fires**.
3. **Preinfusion drip** — when preinfusion lasted > 1 s and at least 0.5 g
   landed during it, emits "Preinfusion: Xg in Ys" as an "observation".
   Not gated on `pourTruncated` — drip mass is a fact, not a diagnosis.
4. **Grind direction** — uses the same `analyzeFlowVsGoal` path as the
   badge. Emits one of: "Pour produced near-zero flow while pressure
   held — puck choked" ("warning") when `chokedPuck` fires, "Flow
   averaged X mL/s below target — grind may be too fine" ("caution"),
   "Flow averaged X mL/s above target — grind may be too coarse"
   ("caution"), "Grind tracked goal during pour" ("good") when
   `verifiedClean` is true AND Arm 1 saw samples, "Puck sustained
   healthy pressure during pour" ("good") when `verifiedClean` is true
   AND Arm 1 saw no samples (Arm 2 supplied the signal alone), or —
   when the detector had no analyzable
   data on a non-degenerate espresso pour — "Could not analyze grind on
   this profile shape — check flow trend, channeling, and taste
   instead" ("observation"). **Suppressed when `pourTruncated` fires.**
5. **Pour truncated** — `detectPourTruncated`. Emits "Pour never
   pressurized (peak X bar) — puck offered no resistance. Likely
   causes: grind way too coarse, distribution failure, no/loose puck,
   severe underdose, or profile without a pressure cap." as "warning"
   when peak pressure stayed under 2.5 bar. The actual peak value is
   substituted into the line.
6. **Skip first frame** — `detectSkipFirstFrame`. Emits "First profile
   step skipped — likely a DE1 firmware bug…" as "warning". Not gated
   on `pourTruncated` — frame-skip is orthogonal to puck integrity.

### Verdict precedence

Exactly one verdict line is appended to every summary. The cascade picks
the first match (more specific failures take precedence over generic
puck-integrity advice):

1. **Pour truncated** → "Don't tune off this shot — peak pressure never
   built, so the other quality signals (channeling, grind direction)
   are unreliable. Check prep (dose, distribution, basket, grind)
   and pull another." Dominates over channeling / grind since the puck
   never built any resistance worth analyzing; leads with
   the meta-action because the shot has no useful tuning signal.
2. **Skip first frame** → "First profile step was skipped — power-cycle…"
   Pre-empts choked-puck because a frame-skip can synthesise extraction
   dynamics that resemble a choke; fix the machine first, then re-evaluate.
3. **Choked puck** → "Puck choked — grind way too fine. Coarsen
   significantly." Pre-empts the generic "Puck integrity issue" verdict
   below.
4. **Has any "warning"** → "Puck integrity issue — improve distribution."
   When a directional grind signal is present alongside, it appends
   "Grind is running fine — try coarser." or "Grind is running coarse —
   try finer." as a modifier (since channeling alone doesn't tell you
   which direction grind is off).
5. **Has any "caution"** → If grind data is directional (`|delta| >
   FLOW_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD`), names the direction ("Grind appears too
   fine — try coarser." / "…too coarse — try finer.") regardless of any
   other cautions also present. Otherwise: "Decent shot with minor
   issues to watch." (The in-source comment phrases this as "if the
   only caution is a grind direction," but the implementation does not
   actually check for uniqueness — a directional grind delta wins over
   a co-occurring flow-trend caution.)
6. **Otherwise, grind not analyzable** → "Clean shot, but grind could not
   be evaluated for this profile shape." Fires when no warnings/cautions
   were emitted AND `grindCoverage == "notAnalyzable"`. Distinguishes
   "verified clean pour" from "we silently had no data to speak from"
   on simple two-marker profiles (Preinfusion + Pour: A-Flow, La Pavoni,
   Malabar, Italian Style). `verdictCategory == "cleanGrindNotAnalyzable"`.
7. **Otherwise** → "Clean shot. Puck held well." `verdictCategory == "clean"`.
   Used when grind was verified or skipped (non-espresso).

### Triggering and lifecycle

The dialog is instantiated declaratively inside `ShotDetailPage.qml` and
`PostShotReviewPage.qml`. The `Shot Summary` chip in `QualityBadges.qml`
emits `summaryRequested()` on tap, which the host page handles by calling
`open()` on its `ShotAnalysisDialog` instance. Analysis lines come from
`shotData.summaryLines`, populated by `convertShotRecord`'s `analyzeShot`
pass on every shot load, so detector improvements take effect on summary
text the same way they do on badges — no save-time freeze. There is no
DB persistence for summary lines; they're regenerated on every load.

### AI advisor consumes the same line list (PR #930)

The in-app AI advisor's prompt is built by `ShotSummarizer::buildUserPrompt`,
which ships the same `analyzeShot` line list under a `## Detector
Observations` section with a preamble framing the lines as detector
evidence (severity tags `[warning]` / `[caution]` / `[good]` /
`[observation]`). The `verdict` line is filtered out so the AI reasons
from the same observations the verdict was built from rather than
anchoring on the dialog's pre-cooked conclusion. On historical shots,
`ShotSummarizer::summarizeFromHistory` prefers the pre-computed
`shotData.summaryLines` (populated by `convertShotRecord`'s `analyzeShot`
pass) and only falls back to running the inline detector orchestration
when that field is absent. Both paths invoke the same `analyzeShot` body,
so they produce equivalent observation lines. The suppression cascade is enforced in
exactly one place — `analyzeShot` — so the badge UI, the dialog, and
the AI advisor cannot drift.

### External MCP agents see structured detectors (PR #933, resolved Issue #931)

`ShotHistoryStorage::convertShotRecord` runs `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot`
once per shot conversion and emits both `summaryLines` (the prose list
the dialog renders) and a nested `detectorResults` JSON object on every
shot record served by `shots_get_detail` / `shots_compare`. The
`detectorResults` shape is documented in
[`docs/CLAUDE_MD/MCP_SERVER.md`](CLAUDE_MD/MCP_SERVER.md) under "Shot
Detector Outputs" and mirrors the `ShotAnalysis::DetectorResults` C++
struct: channeling severity, flow trend, grind direction (with
`chokedPuck` / `yieldOvershoot` flags), pour-truncated + peak pressure,
skip-first-frame, and a stable enum-like `verdictCategory` string.

The struct is a *superset* of what `summaryLines` renders — clean
signals (`flowTrend = "stable"`, `grindDirection = "onTarget"`) appear
in `detectorResults` but produce no prose line. The verdict prose is
intentionally NOT exposed as a separate field; external agents read
`verdictCategory` and compose their own framing.

The four legacy badge booleans (`channelingDetected`, etc.) on
`convertShotRecord` remain available for backwards compatibility.

---

## 4. Persistence semantics

### Save-time: stored columns

The `shots` table has four flag columns: `pour_truncated_detected`,
`channeling_detected`, `grind_issue_detected`,
`skip_first_frame_detected`. At shot save (or import), the badges are
computed once from the captured curves and written into these columns
alongside the rest of the shot record. The historical fifth column
(`temperature_unstable`) was added in migration 10 and dropped in
migration 15 — see openspec change `remove-temperature-unstable-badge`.

### Single-pass detector pipeline + projection (post PR #934, #935, #936)

`saveShot` and `loadShotRecordStatic` both compute all four quality
badges via a single `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot(...)` call and project the
booleans from the returned `DetectorResults` struct using the helper in
`src/history/shotbadgeprojection.h`. The cascade lives in exactly one
place — `analyzeShot`'s body — and the badge columns are a deterministic
projection of the typed struct. No more hand-rolled per-detector calls
or hand-rolled gate conditions in the storage layer.

**Badge ↔ `DetectorResults` mapping:**

| Badge column | `DetectorResults` projection |
|---|---|
| `pourTruncatedDetected` | `d.pourTruncated` |
| `channelingDetected` | `d.channelingSeverity == "sustained"` (Transient does NOT fire the badge) |
| `grindIssueDetected` | `d.grindHasData && (d.grindChokedPuck \|\| d.grindYieldOvershoot \|\| std::abs(d.grindFlowDeltaMlPerSec) > FLOW_DEVIATION_THRESHOLD)` |
| `skipFirstFrameDetected` | `d.skipFirstFrame` |

Notes on the projection:

- `channelingDetected` deliberately uses `Sustained`-only. Transient
  channeling shows in the dialog as a "Transient channel at Xs"
  caution line and in MCP `detectorResults.channeling.severity` as
  `"transient"`, but the boolean badge column stays `false`. Carries
  forward PR #922's invariant.
- `grindIssueDetected` mirrors `ShotAnalysis::detectGrindIssue` exactly.
  The `grindHasData` conjunct is a defensive zero — it short-circuits
  the projection if any of the grind sub-flags are set on a struct
  whose `hasData` is false.
- `pourTruncated` and `skipFirstFrame` are 1:1 with their struct fields.

The projection is unit-tested via `tst_shotanalysis::badgeProjection_*` —
each row of the mapping table has at least one regression test, including
the load-bearing `Transient` carve-out.

### Load-time: always recompute (PR #893, extended for the 5th badge in PR #922)

`ShotHistoryStorage::loadShotRecordStatic` reads the stored columns, then
**unconditionally recomputes all four badges** from the loaded curve data
before returning. The recompute is now a single `analyzeShot` + projection
call (post PR #936), so it cannot diverge from the save-time computation.
This means the in-memory `ShotRecord` always reflects the current detector
logic and the cascade is consistent between save and load.

The recompute uses on-the-fly derived curves for legacy shots that lack them:
`computeDerivedCurves` fills `conductanceDerivative` from `pressure`/`flow`
when the shot predates migration 10 (the `conductance` column).

The grind coverage signal (`grindCoverage`, `grindVerifiedClean`) is part
of the `DetectorResults` payload that `analyzeShot` produces; like
`summaryLines`, it is **not** stored in the database — it is recomputed
on every load and emitted by `convertShotRecord` as part of the
structured `detectorResults` JSON for MCP / dialog consumers.

### Lazy persist on view (PR #893)

`ShotHistoryStorage::requestReanalyzeBadges(id)` runs on the DB worker
thread and recomputes the four flags. If at least one flag differs from the
stored value, it issues an `UPDATE` *and* emits `shotBadgesUpdated(shotId,
channeling, grindIssue, skipFirstFrame, pourTruncated)` (five args) so the
UI can refresh without a full reload. If every flag already matches the
stored value, the worker exits silently — no `UPDATE`, no signal, no UI
refresh.

Note: the QML pages no longer call it from `onShotReady` — drift detection
and persistence now ride the load path itself (`loadShotRecordStatic`
recomputes via the badge projection and persists corrected flags inline),
so the invokable survives mainly for programmatic re-analysis.

### Yield anchor provenance (add-yield-ratio-anchor, migration 34)

`shots.yield_override` is untouched by the yield-anchor change: it stays
the **resolved gram target** every detector reads (the yield-overshoot and
shortfall arms are pure `finalWeightG / targetWeightG` — no ratio ever
reaches them, because resolution to grams happens upstream of
`MachineState::setTargetWeight`). Two columns record the anchor that
*produced* that target: `yield_mode` (`none` | `absolute` | `ratio`) and
`yield_anchor_value` (grams when absolute, a dose multiplier when ratio).
They are intent alongside outcome — stored at save time, never derived at
read time (the dose is post-shot editable, and deriving would mint a ratio
nobody chose). Promotion (`RecipePromotion::fieldsFromShotRecord`) copies
them verbatim; legacy rows were backfilled `absolute` from a >0
`yield_override`, else `none`. The detectors, the badge pipeline, and this
document's gate semantics are unaffected.

### Residual gap (Issue #894)

`requestShotsFiltered` → `buildFilterQuery()` (around
`shothistorystorage.cpp:1463-1474`) builds badge filters against the **stored
columns**, not the recomputed values. The MCP `shots_list` tool reads the
same stored columns. So a shot whose recomputed badges no longer match the
stored values is consistent in the detail view (after one open, lazy persist
catches up) but inconsistent in:

- The history-list filter chips ("Show only channeling shots") for shots not
  yet viewed under the current detectors.
- `shots_list` MCP responses for the same.

Tracked in #894. Options on the table: a one-shot bulk resweep (option 1),
adding a manual "Re-analyze all shots" button (option 2), or both (hybrid).
Held until the detectors stabilize — the next round of fixes would just
require another sweep.

## 5. Code map

### Detector logic

- `src/ai/shotanalysis.{h,cpp}` — all four detectors, `analyzeFlowVsGoal`,
  `buildChannelingWindows`, `detectChannelingFromDerivative`,
  `detectGrindIssue`, `detectSkipFirstFrame`, `detectPourTruncated`,
  `shouldSkipChannelingCheck`, `analyzeShot` (returns
  `AnalysisResult { lines, detectors }` — feeds the Shot Summary dialog
  and MCP; see §3), `generateSummary` (thin wrapper returning
  `analyzeShot(...).lines`), `DetectorResults` / `AnalysisResult`
  structs, all tuning constants.

### Persistence

- `src/history/shothistorystorage.{h,cpp}`:
  - `loadShotRecordStatic` — load + recompute block (the "always recompute
    every quality badge" comment marks the section).
  - `requestReanalyzeBadges` — lazy-persist worker.
  - `requestShotsFiltered` + `buildFilterQuery` — history-list filter that
    reads the stored columns.
  - `convertShotRecord` — runs `analyzeShot` once per shot conversion
    (or reuses `record.cachedAnalysis` populated by `loadShotRecordStatic`);
    emits `summaryLines` (prose) and a nested `detectorResults` JSON
    object on every shot record served by MCP / web endpoints. The dialog
    reads `summaryLines` directly from the resulting `shotData` map.
  - DB migrations for the four flag columns (10–13; migration 13 adds
    `pour_truncated_detected`; migration 15 drops the
    `temperature_unstable` column added by migration 10).
  - `computeDerivedCurves` — fills conductance / dC/dt for legacy shots that
    predate migration 10.
  - `profileFrameInfoFromJson` — extracts `frameCount` and
    `firstFrameSeconds` for `detectSkipFirstFrame` and the summary path.

### Profile-level analysis flags

- `src/profile/profileknowledge.{h,cpp}` — KB entries that carry per-profile
  `analysisFlags` (`channeling_expected`, `grind_check_skip`,
  `bloom_self_heal`, etc.).
- `ShotSummarizer::getAnalysisFlags(profileKbId)` is the canonical lookup
  used by both detector callers and `loadShotRecordStatic`.

### UI

- `qml/components/QualityBadges.qml` — chip rendering. One chip per active
  flag; when none active, a single "Clean extraction" chip; always a
  trailing "Shot Summary" chip that emits `summaryRequested()`.
- `qml/components/ShotAnalysisDialog.qml` — Shot Summary dialog. Reads
  `shotData.summaryLines` directly (populated by `convertShotRecord`)
  and renders the `{ text, type }` lines via a `Repeater`.
- `qml/pages/ShotDetailPage.qml` and `qml/pages/PostShotReviewPage.qml` —
  consume `shotData.channelingDetected` / `grindIssueDetected` /
  `skipFirstFrameDetected` / `pourTruncatedDetected`, listen for
  `shotBadgesUpdated`, call `requestReanalyzeBadges` on load, host the
  `ShotAnalysisDialog` instance and wire `summaryRequested` to `open()`.
- `qml/pages/ShotHistoryPage.qml` — filter chips that consume the stored
  columns.

### MCP

- `src/mcp/mcptools_shots.cpp` — `shots_list` reads stored columns;
  `shots_get_detail` runs through `loadShotRecordStatic` and so reflects
  recomputed badges.

---

## 6. Regression corpus

`tools/shot_eval/` is a CLI harness that runs the live detectors against a
curated corpus of shot fixtures and prints (or validates) the verdicts.

- **Fixtures**: `tests/data/shots/*.json` — curated real shots covering
  lever-clean (Cremina, E61, Damian LRv3, classic Italian), lever / E61
  failure modes (80's Espresso choked moderate / puck failure, classic
  Italian fast, Londinium gusher, blooming aborted / choker, puck-failure
  short gusher), grind-fine (Malabar D-Flow), and Adaptive v2 cases (Gagne).
- **Manifest**: `tests/data/shots/manifest.json` — golden verdicts per
  fixture.
- **CTest target**: `shot_corpus_regression` (declared in
  `tests/CMakeLists.txt`) runs `shot_eval --validate manifest.json`. Linux
  CI catches detector regressions before merge.

To add a fixture:

1. Drop the captured shot JSON in `tests/data/shots/`.
2. Add an entry to `manifest.json` with the expected badge / verdict.
3. Run `shot_eval --validate` locally (or via the ctest target) to confirm.
4. Commit both files together so the manifest documents the new golden.

- PR #930 / Issue #921 — `ShotSummarizer` (AI advisor prompt path) now
  shares the suppression cascade. Detector orchestration delegates to
  `ShotAnalysis::analyzeShot` — the same pipeline `convertShotRecord`
  uses to populate `summaryLines` for the dialog. The prompt's
  `## Detector Observations` section
  emits `analyzeShot`'s line list verbatim with severity tags
  (`[warning]` / `[caution]` / `[good]` / `[observation]`) under a preamble
  framing the lines as detector evidence. The `verdict` line is filtered
  out before emission so the AI reasons from the same observations the
  user sees in the dialog without anchoring on the dialog's prescriptive
  conclusion. Cleanup: dropped dead `ShotSummary` fields
  (`channelingDetected`, `timeToFirstDrip`, `preinfusionDuration`,
  `mainExtractionDuration`) and the wrapper helpers
  (`detectChannelingInPhases`) they fed.
- PR #933 / Issue #931 — `convertShotRecord` runs `analyzeShot` once
  per shot conversion and emits both `summaryLines` (prose) and
  structured `detectorResults` JSON on `shots_get_detail` /
  `shots_compare`. Refactored `generateSummary` into a thin wrapper
  over the new `analyzeShot()` entry point that returns
  `AnalysisResult { lines, detectors }`. The `DetectorResults` struct
  is the source for prose; sharing one detector pass keeps both
  outputs in lockstep. Verdict prose is intentionally NOT exposed —
  agents read the stable `verdictCategory` enum instead. Field
  reference: `docs/CLAUDE_MD/MCP_SERVER.md` "Shot Detector Outputs".
- openspec change `remove-temperature-unstable-badge` / Issue #1128 —
  retired the `temperatureUnstable` badge end-to-end (detector,
  projection, badge UI, MCP `detectorResults.tempStability`, history
  filter, DB column via migration 15). The detector measured average
  deviation from goal but was labeled "Temp unstable" — and the
  deviation it caught was, in practice, profile-design intent on
  D-Flow / Extractamundo / TurboBloom and 9+ other built-in profiles.
  `analyzeShot` and `generateSummary` lost their `temperature` and
  `temperatureGoal` parameters; the static helpers
  `hasIntentionalTempStepping`, `avgTempDeviation`, and
  `reachedExtractionPhase` were removed. `shotBadgesUpdated` shrank
  from 6 to 5 args.
- PR #1141 / Issue #1128 (grind half — same issue number, second
  half of the report) — added the flow-goal stationarity gate to
  Arm 1 of the grind detector (`FLOW_GOAL_STATIONARY_HALF_SEC = 0.75`,
  `FLOW_GOAL_STATIONARY_REL = 0.15`, see §2.2). Fixes a false-positive
  "Grind too coarse" badge on Extractamundo Dos!-style profiles whose
  "dynamic bloom" frame is `pump=flow, flow=0, exit_pressure_under`:
  the firmware ramps flow down to zero so the puck bleeds preinfusion
  pressure naturally; the rapidly-decaying flow goal isn't a target
  the puck should track, but Arm 1 used to average against it and
  produce a confident `+3.2 mL/s` over-goal delta on shots the
  reporter rated 90/100 and 94/100. The new gate rejects samples
  whose flow_goal moves more than 15 % across ±0.75 s — naturally
  excluding bloom-decay frames without changing flat-target behavior.
  Added two regression fixtures: real shot 464 from the field
  (`extractamundo_dos_dynamic_bloom_clean.json`) and a synthetic
  puck-failure gusher that exercises the `pourTruncated` +
  `yieldOvershoot` cascade interaction at the detector level
  (`synthetic_puck_failure_gusher.json`).
