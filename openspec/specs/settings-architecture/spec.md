# settings-architecture Specification

## Purpose
Defines the decomposition of the monolithic `Settings` class into domain sub-objects (`SettingsMqtt`, `SettingsCalibration`, `SettingsBrew`, etc.), each owning its own `QSettings` instance and property set, with `Settings` reduced to a thin façade exposing sub-object accessors and cross-domain wiring. Specifies the required QML access pattern (`Settings.<domain>.<prop>`), the narrow-header-inclusion rule that bounds recompilation blast radius for domain-specific consumers, and the extraction of shot-history data structures into their own header.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Settings Domain Decomposition

The `Settings` class SHALL be decomposed into domain sub-objects. Each domain sub-object SHALL be a standalone `QObject` subclass owning its own `QSettings` instance and containing only the properties, signals, and methods for its domain. `Settings` SHALL own the domain objects, construct them as children, and expose each via a `Q_PROPERTY(QObject* domain READ domainQObject CONSTANT)` accessor (the `QObject*` type is required so QML can resolve via runtime metaObject without including the domain header in `settings.h`). C++ callers SHALL use a typed inline accessor (`SettingsDomain* domain() const`) declared alongside the `Q_PROPERTY`. The final `settings.h` SHALL contain only sub-object accessors and cross-domain methods (`sync`, `factoryReset`, cross-domain `connect()` declarations) and SHALL be under 200 lines.

The complete domain set SHALL be: `SettingsMqtt`, `SettingsAutoWake`, `SettingsHardware`, `SettingsAI`, `SettingsTheme`, `SettingsVisualizer`, `SettingsMcp`, `SettingsBrew`, `SettingsDye`, `SettingsNetwork`, `SettingsApp`, `SettingsCalibration`.

#### Scenario: Domain sub-object is independently includable
- **WHEN** a component depends only on a single domain's settings
- **THEN** it includes that domain's header (e.g., `settings_calibration.h`) and receives a `SettingsCalibration*` — not `Settings*`
- **AND** changing any non-Calibration domain header does not trigger recompilation of that component

#### Scenario: Settings.h is a thin façade
- **WHEN** all 12 domain splits are complete
- **THEN** `settings.h` contains only sub-object `Q_PROPERTY` accessors, typed inline accessors, cross-domain method declarations, and `sync`/`factoryReset`
- **AND** `settings.h` is under 200 lines
- **AND** `settings.h` contains no `Q_PROPERTY` for any property that has been moved to a sub-object

#### Scenario: Each new domain sub-object is QML-introspectable
- **WHEN** a new `Settings<Domain>` class is added
- **THEN** `main.cpp` calls `qmlRegisterUncreatableType<Settings<Domain>>("Decenza", 1, 0, "Settings<Domain>Type", ...)`
- **AND** QML expressions like `Settings.<domain>.<prop>` resolve to the sub-object's property at runtime, not to `undefined`

#### Scenario: Cross-domain side effects use connect-based wiring
- **WHEN** changing a property on one domain must trigger an update on another domain (e.g., `resetSawLearning` on `SettingsCalibration` must reset hot-water SAW offset state on `SettingsBrew`)
- **THEN** the wiring is established via `connect()` in the `Settings::Settings()` constructor body, after all `m_<domain>` members are constructed
- **AND** the sub-object's setter does not directly call methods on another domain

#### Scenario: Cross-domain wiring SHALL NOT mirror a setting onto per-shot state
- **WHEN** a proposed cross-domain wiring would copy a configured setting into a field that is snapshotted onto a shot at save time
- **THEN** the wiring SHALL NOT be established
- **AND** the value SHALL be written to the shot record at the point a person supplies it instead
- **AND** the reason SHALL be understood as concrete rather than stylistic: the removed `setDefaultShotRating` → `setDyeEspressoEnjoyment` wiring is what made a deleted setting keep rating shots, because the mirrored field outlived the setting that fed it

### Requirement: QML Sub-Object Access

All QML code that accesses settings SHALL use the domain sub-object accessor (e.g., `Settings.calibration.sawLearnedLag`) rather than the flat `Settings` property (e.g., `Settings.sawLearnedLag`). `Connections` blocks that target settings properties SHALL target the domain sub-object (`Connections { target: Settings.calibration }`). The flat `Settings.X` form is valid only for properties that genuinely remain on `Settings` itself (currently: only the 12 sub-object accessors plus any cross-domain coordinator state).

#### Scenario: QML reads a setting via domain sub-object
- **WHEN** `SettingsCalibrationTab.qml` reads the SAW learned lag
- **THEN** it accesses `Settings.calibration.sawLearnedLag`
- **AND** the binding updates when `SettingsCalibration::sawLearnedLagChanged` fires

#### Scenario: No flat Settings.* access for migrated properties
- **WHEN** the codebase is searched for `Settings\.sawLearnedLag` (or any other migrated property — `profileFlowCalibration`, `autoFlowCalibration`, `flowCalibrationMultiplier`, `sawModelSource`, etc.) in QML files
- **THEN** zero matches are found
- **AND** every reader uses the domain-prefixed form

#### Scenario: QML Connections target the sub-object
- **WHEN** a QML component listens for changes to a migrated calibration property's signal
- **THEN** it uses `Connections { target: Settings.calibration }`
- **AND** not `Connections { target: Settings }` — the latter would silently never fire

### Requirement: Narrow Consumer Header Isolation

Each domain-specific C++ consumer (a class that reads only one domain's settings) SHALL include only the domain header, not `settings.h`. Its constructor SHALL accept the domain sub-object pointer instead of `Settings*`. `main.cpp` SHALL pass the sub-object accessor (e.g., `settings.brew()`) at the call site. Wide consumers (classes that touch multiple domains, e.g., `MainController`, `settingsserializer.cpp`) MAY keep `Settings*` and access domains via `settings->domain()->X()`.

#### Scenario: Narrow consumer does not include settings.h
- **WHEN** a domain-specific consumer's header is compiled
- **THEN** the file does not `#include "settings.h"` and does not include any other domain's header
- **AND** changing `settings.h` does not trigger its recompilation

#### Scenario: Settings.h transitive includer count is bounded
- **WHEN** the project is fully migrated
- **THEN** the count of `.cpp` files that transitively include `settings.h` is 10 or fewer
- **AND** measurement comparison with the pre-Tier-1 baseline (39 includers) is documented in the merging PR

### Requirement: Shot History Types Extraction

The data structures defined in `shothistorystorage.h` (`ShotRecord`, `HistoryShotSummary`, `ShotFilter`, `ShotSaveData`, `GrinderContext`, `HistoryPhaseMarker`) SHALL be extracted to `shothistory_types.h`. `shothistorystorage.h` SHALL `#include "shothistory_types.h"`. Components that only store a `ShotHistoryStorage*` pointer and call simple accessors (`databasePath()`, `totalShots()`, `isReady()`) SHALL forward-declare `ShotHistoryStorage` in their headers and include `shothistorystorage.h` only in their `.cpp`.

#### Scenario: Pointer-only consumer avoids full header
- **WHEN** `DatabaseBackupManager` is compiled
- **THEN** it uses `class ShotHistoryStorage;` forward declaration in its header
- **AND** includes `shothistorystorage.h` only in its `.cpp`
- **AND** changing shot history struct definitions does not trigger its recompilation

#### Scenario: Struct consumers include the types header
- **WHEN** `ShotAnalysis` uses `ShotRecord` fields
- **THEN** it includes `shothistory_types.h` (or `shothistorystorage.h` which re-exports it)
- **AND** its compile behaviour is unchanged from before the extraction

### Requirement: Storage Key Stability

Each domain sub-object's `QSettings` operations SHALL use the same key strings the property used before being migrated to the sub-object. No migration of existing user settings is required — opening a separate `QSettings("DecentEspresso", "DE1Qt")` handle in each sub-object provides shared access to the same backing store.

#### Scenario: Existing user settings persist across the migration
- **WHEN** a user upgrades from a build with `Settings::sawLearnedLag` to a build with `SettingsCalibration::sawLearnedLag`
- **THEN** the previously-saved SAW learning history (`saw/learningHistory`, `saw/perProfileHistory`, `saw/perProfileBatch`, `saw/globalBootstrapLag/<scale>`) is read correctly on first launch
- **AND** the previously-saved flow calibration values (`calibration/flowMultiplier`, `calibration/autoFlowCalibration`, `calibration/perProfileFlow`, `calibration/flowCalBatch`) are read correctly on first launch
- **AND** no settings reset or migration step is required

#### Scenario: Key strings match pre-split values
- **WHEN** a property's setter or getter is reviewed in `SettingsCalibration`
- **THEN** the string passed to `m_settings.value(...)` / `m_settings.setValue(...)` is byte-identical to the pre-migration string in `settings.cpp`

### Requirement: Calibration Domain Surface

The `SettingsCalibration` domain sub-object SHALL own the auto flow calibration surface and the SAW (stop-at-weight) learning surface in their entirety. No calibration or SAW-related property, invokable, signal, cache, or static helper SHALL remain on `Settings` itself after Tier 3 lands.

The auto flow calibration surface comprises: `flowCalibrationMultiplier`, `autoFlowCalibration`, `profileFlowCalibration`, `setProfileFlowCalibration`, `clearProfileFlowCalibration`, `effectiveFlowCalibration`, `hasProfileFlowCalibration`, `allProfileFlowCalibrations`, `perProfileFlowCalVersion`, `flowCalPendingIdeals`, `appendFlowCalPendingIdeal`, `clearFlowCalPendingIdeals`, plus the `flowCalibrationMultiplierChanged`, `autoFlowCalibrationChanged`, and `perProfileFlowCalibrationChanged` signals.

The SAW learning surface comprises: `sawLearnedLag`, `sawLearnedLagFor`, `getExpectedDrip`, `getExpectedDripFor`, `sawLearningEntries`, `sawLearningEntriesFor`, `sawModelSource`, `addSawLearningPoint`, `resetSawLearning`, `resetSawLearningForProfile`, `isSawConverged`, `perProfileSawHistory`, `allPerProfileSawHistory`, `sawPendingBatch`, `globalSawBootstrapLag`, `setGlobalSawBootstrapLag`, the static `sensorLag(scaleType)` helper, plus the `sawLearnedLagChanged` signal and the file-scope constants `kSawMinMediansForGraduation`, `kBatchSize`, `kMaxPairHistory`, `kBatchMaxIqr`, `kBatchMaxDeviation`.

#### Scenario: Calibration surface lives on the sub-object
- **WHEN** a developer searches `src/core/settings.h` for `flowCalibrationMultiplier`, `sawLearnedLag`, `profileFlowCalibration`, `addSawLearningPoint`, `getExpectedDrip`, `sawModelSource`, or any other listed name
- **THEN** zero matches are found in `settings.h`
- **AND** every listed name appears only in `settings_calibration.h` and `settings_calibration.cpp`

#### Scenario: Calibration cross-domain reset goes through connect-based wiring
- **WHEN** `SettingsCalibration::resetSawLearning` is invoked from QML or C++
- **THEN** the sub-object emits a `sawLearningResetRequested` signal (or equivalent) and does not directly call `SettingsBrew` setters
- **AND** the hot-water SAW offset and sample count are reset on `SettingsBrew` via a `connect()` established in the `Settings::Settings()` constructor body

### Requirement: Removing a setting SHALL remove its stored key

When a setting is removed, deleting its property and accessors SHALL NOT be
considered sufficient. Every key the removed feature wrote SHALL also be evicted
from the settings store, including keys written by fields the setting fed, so an
upgraded store carries no orphaned value from the removed feature.

Eviction SHALL be idempotent — a removal of an absent key is a no-op — so it can
run unconditionally on construction without a version counter or migration
framework.

This requirement exists because a store is shared mutable state with an unbounded
lifetime: an orphaned value is only inert for as long as nothing reads it, and the
next reader is written by someone who never knew the feature existed.

#### Scenario: Removed setting leaves no key behind

- **GIVEN** a settings store written by a build that had the removed feature
- **WHEN** the user upgrades to a build where the feature is gone
- **THEN** the store SHALL contain no key that the removed feature wrote
- **AND** a subsequent launch SHALL perform no further eviction work
