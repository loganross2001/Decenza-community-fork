// During-steam live coaching cues — a LOCAL, real-time "reflex" layer that talks
// you through steaming milk AS IT HAPPENS. This is NOT the AI advisor (post-shot,
// network-backed): it runs cheap C++ checks on the live steam telemetry and emits
// at most one short, calm cue at a time, favouring silence.
//
// The DE1 does not measure milk temperature, so cues are NOT keyed off a milk
// thermometer. Instead they follow the elapsed steam time vs the target steam
// duration (Settings.brew.steamTimeout — weight-scaled for calibrated pitchers):
// stretch at the start, roll/texture through the middle, and an "almost" heads-up
// near the end. The end-of-steam "done" cue is NOT time-predicted: it fires from
// MachineState::steamFlowStopped() — the actual machine event that ends steam
// flow — so clock/firmware drift within the completion window can't cause a
// missed cue (drift beyond it classifies as an abort; see COMPLETION_WINDOW_SEC).
// An early manual stop (well before the target) is a deliberate abort and stays
// silent.
//
// Gating: two independent user settings, both off by default.
//   - Settings.app.steamCoachVisualEnabled — the on-screen banner (QML binds the
//     cue surface below).
//   - Settings.app.steamCoachAudioEnabled — spoken cues. The coach itself emits
//     speakRequested() (wired to AccessibilityManager::announceCoaching in
//     main.cpp), so audio works with the banner disabled and is independent of
//     the accessibility master switch.
// When both are off the coach does no per-tick evaluation work (the tick slot
// still runs, returning after two cached-bool checks).
//
// Milk-derived duration requirement: coaching only happens when the session's
// steam duration was derived from the ACTUAL milk weight (weight-timed steaming
// captured the pitcher on the scale — SteamPage binds `durationMilkDerived`
// from its steamTimeoutScaled state). A fixed preset duration says nothing
// about the milk in the pitcher, so pacing cues off it would confidently
// endorse ruining the milk (200 mL against a 60 s preset is destroyed long
// before "Almost there"). Without a milk-derived duration the coach emits a
// single informational pill ("No coaching — milk weight not captured") —
// shown on the banner and spoken politely when the audio setting is on, so an
// audio-only user isn't left with unexplained silence — and otherwise behaves
// as if the feature were off.
//
// Rate control is one-shot latching only — each milestone fires at most once per
// steam operation (at most four cues total), so no spacing governor is needed and
// no distinct milestone can ever be rate-limited away.
//
// Cues are exposed to QML as individual marshalable Q_PROPERTYs (QString / bool)
// — never a struct return — so LiveCoachingBanner (steam page mount) can bind
// directly. The banner is purely visual; it does not speak.
