// Collapses a repeating log line, carrying the count of what it stood in for.
//
// Two modes, and kChangesOnly is the one a periodic source wants: an unchanged line never repeats,
// however long it has been. A window (the other mode) is for a source already gated on a problem,
// where the repeat is itself evidence. See kChangesOnly for which is which and why.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AS ONE CLASS
// ----------------------------
// Three unrelated periodic sources — the MMR USB-charger keepalive (60 s), the memory sampler
// (60 s) and the ShotServer request log (a 5 s browser poll) — each wanted the same behaviour, and
// each was about to grow its own copy of it. In a 48-hour tablet capture they were 3,147 + 3,107 +
// 954 lines, 35% of the entire log, and every line was near-identical to the one before it. A
// fourth copy of "remember the last text, count repeats, print a summary" is exactly the drift the
// centralize rule in CLAUDE.md is about, so it lives here and they call it.
//
// It is deliberately NOT a general log filter and NOT tied to a category: callers keep their own
// qDebug()/qWarning() and their own wording. All this decides is whether to speak.
//
// NO TIMERS
// ---------
// The window is checked against the message's own arrival, not driven by a QTimer — a suppressed
// run is flushed by the next message in that run, not by a clock. That keeps this a pure decision
// function with no ownership, no thread affinity and nothing to stop, and it is why a source that
// falls silent mid-window simply stops: its last suppressed count is folded into the next line it
// does emit. For a periodic source (which is all three callers) the difference is one line at the
// end of the run, and in exchange there is no timer to leak or fire after teardown.
class LogCollapse
{
public:
    // ON RUN ENDS, which is the one thing a caller has to get right and the thing four of six got
    // wrong.
    //
    // A source that runs for the process lifetime cannot leak — the memory sampler, the battery
    // poll. Every OTHER source eventually goes quiet, and when it does its pending tally sits in
    // the table until the next run reuses the key and prints it annotated with a span measured to
    // THAT moment: last week's repeat count on today's first line. Such a source must flush() or
    // flushAll() at whatever event ends its run.
    //
    // This was a rule in a comment on flush() and it stayed one until someone checked the callers:
    // of six, three are episodic and two of those never flushed (the MMR keepalive across a
    // disconnect, the ShotServer request log across a server stop). Both are fixed, and every
    // declaration site now states which kind it is and where it flushes.
    //
    // It is NOT a constructor mode with a destructor assert. That was built and removed: process
    // exit is not a run end anyone can observe, so an episodic source holds a legitimate tally when
    // it is destroyed, and the assert aborted on a CORRECT caller — MqttClient, which flushes on
    // every reconnect, died at teardown. With the assert gone the mode had no reader at all and the
    // compiler said so (-Wunused-private-field). An enum nobody reads is a comment with a type, so
    // this is the comment.

    // A window meaning "an unchanged line is never worth repeating, at any spacing".
    //
    // This is the DEFAULT for a periodic source, and every periodic caller in the tree uses it. A
    // window was the original design and it was the wrong unit: it asks "how often may this line
    // repeat" when the question is "does a repeat carry anything". For a source whose text is
    // unchanged the answer does not improve with elapsed time — a byte-identical charger keepalive
    // an hour after the last one tells a reader exactly what the last one did, and costs a line of
    // a ring buffer that has to hold everything else. Six lines an hour is not noticeably better
    // than six hundred when none of them say anything.
    //
    // What replaces the periodic reassurance is the pair that always did the work: a CHANGED line,
    // which emits at once, and the run-end flush, which prints the tally. Between them the reader
    // gets the transition and the count it stood for, and nothing in between. The cost is that
    // silence no longer distinguishes "healthy" from "stopped" until the flush — accepted
    // deliberately, because for all five callers a death is visible in lines this one does not own
    // (a disconnect, a broker error, a server stop).
    //
    // A source that is already gated on a PROBLEM does not want this and must keep a real window:
    // its repeats are evidence, not reassurance. BleGattQueue's dispatch line is the one such
    // caller — it speaks only above a foreign-wait threshold, within episodes lasting under a
    // second, so a window is what separates two operations inside one stall.
