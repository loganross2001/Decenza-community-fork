# Findings

Divergences between Decenza and the upstream plugins, found by
`tests/tst_recipeeditorparity.cpp`. Each is a live expected-failure in the suite, so the gate
records reality rather than a weakened assertion (design D7).

Oracle: `D_Flow_Espresso_Profile` @ `7f3c9726` (v3.1), `A_Flow` @ `e1a4d871` (v2.0-beta.2-2),
both verified at upstream HEAD on 2026-07-25.

**Status: D-Flow (§2) complete. A-Flow (§3–5) not yet run.**

## What passed

Worth stating, because it bounds the problem. On all three stock D-Flow profiles:

- **Extraction matches `prep` exactly** — every one of the eight parameters, including the two
  that are easy to get wrong: pour pressure read from `pouring(max_flow_or_pressure)` rather than
  the vestigial `pouring(pressure)`, and soak time via `round_to_one_digits`.
- **Generation matches `update_D-Flow`** on every field that proc writes.
- **The derived fill-pressure rule is exactly right** across all six branches, including the
  `< 2.8` threshold, the `soak/2 + 0.6` formula, and the 1.2 floor.
- **The D-Flow/A-Flow temperature asymmetry is correct** — D-Flow's soak frame takes the *pour*
  temperature, and Decenza does that.

So the core of the D-Flow implementation is faithful. Every finding below is a field Decenza
writes that the plugin does not.

---

## Does it all make a whole? Yes — and that is what makes the findings findings

Read against de1app's shot-execution path, the plugin and its profiles are one coherent design,
not code plus stale data. Three facts settle it:

| frame field | where it goes | source |
|---|---|---|
| `weight` | app-side: `profile_target`, and exceeding it calls `start_next_step` | `device_scale.tcl:1210,1254` |
| `volume` | **to the machine**, packed unconditionally as `MaxVol` | `binary.tcl:967` |
| `exit_pressure_over` | to the machine **only when `exit_if 1`**; otherwise `TriggerVal 0` | `binary.tcl:933,955` |

And the firmware's own contract for `MaxVol`, quoted from de1app:

> `U10P0  MaxVol;  // Exit current frame if the volume/weight exceeds this value. 0 means ignore`

So the division of labour is clean:

1. **The editor owns exactly eight parameters** — fill temperature; soak seconds/pressure/volume/
   weight; pour flow/pressure/temperature. That is the whole of `prep`, and the whole of what
   `update_D-Flow` writes back.
2. **Everything else is per-profile character**, baked in by the author: the fill volume cap, the
   fill weight-skip, the pour volume cap, the fill exit pressure.
3. **`update_D-Flow` mutates in place precisely so editing the eight never disturbs the rest.**
   That is not an implementation detail — it is the mechanism that lets one editor drive three
   profiles with different machine personalities.

The three stock profiles then differ in exactly the non-editor fields, deliberately:

| | fill vol | fill wt | pour vol |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-Flow / default | 100 | 5.00 (skip at 5 g) | 0 (uncapped) |
| D-Flow / Q | 60 | 0.00 (no skip) | 100 |
| D-Flow / La Pavoni | 60 | 0.00 (no skip) | 100 |

Q and La Pavoni are lever simulations: a 60 mL fill cap, a 100 mL pour cap, no weight-skip.
Default is the everyday profile: uncapped pour, 5 g fill skip. Coherent, and each choice is
visible in what reaches the machine.

**The whole holds provided the editor preserves what it does not own.** That is the contract
Decenza breaks — and the shape of the break is specific:

> **Every constant Decenza hardcodes is `D-Flow / default`'s value.**
> fill volume 100, fill weight 5.0, pour volume 0 — default's, all three.

The D-Flow generator was written by reading one profile and promoting its literals to universal
constants. Q and La Pavoni are the two that differ, and they are exactly the two that get
overwritten. That is one root cause with three symptoms, not three bugs.

### Two corrections to the first pass of this document

- **DF-3 is not "stale upstream data".** I called it that before reading the execution path. Under
  the intentional reading it is the opposite: the shipped exit pressures are authored values, and
  `update_D-Flow`'s derived rule is the *fallback* for when the user changes soak pressure — it
  recomputes because it must emit something, not because the authored value was wrong. de1app
  moving default's 1.5 → 2.1 on first edit is an accepted consequence of editing. Nothing to
  report upstream; **DF-3 is retired as a defect**, and Decenza's behaviour is correct.
- **DF-1 and DF-5 are not "low severity, inert".** `volume` is packed into `MaxVol` and sent to
  the DE1 unconditionally. They change what the machine does. DF-5 in particular removes a cap
  rather than shifting one — see below.

---

## DF-1 — `filling(volume)` forced to 100 · Decenza defect · reaches the machine

`RecipeGenerator::createFillFrame` hardcodes `frame.volume = 100.0`. `update_D-Flow` never writes
`filling(volume)`, so the plugin preserves whatever the profile carried. **D-Flow / Q** and
**D-Flow / La Pavoni** both ship `60`.

Effect: opening either in Decenza and saving relaxes the fill frame's `MaxVol` from 60 mL to
100 mL. Both values are non-zero, so the cap stays armed — it just moves. In practice the fill
exits on pressure well before either, so the practical impact is small; but this is a value sent
to the DE1, not stored metadata, and it is a silent edit to a profile the plugin leaves alone.

## DF-2 — `filling(weight)` forced to 5 g · Decenza defect · **shot-affecting**

`createFillFrame` hardcodes `frame.exitWeight = 5.0`, commented *"matches de1app default: weight
5.00"*. That value is only **D-Flow / default**'s. **Q** and **La Pavoni** both ship `weight 0.00`
— meaning *no* weight exit — and `update_D-Flow` never writes the field.

Effect: Decenza imposes a 5 g app-side exit on a fill step whose author asked for none, cutting
the fill short. This is the most serious D-Flow finding: it changes what the machine does, on two
of the three shipped profiles, without the user touching anything but Save.

The comment is the tell — a value observed in one profile was generalised into a constant.

## DF-3 — `filling(exit_pressure_over)` recomputed · **RETIRED — not a defect**

Decenza applies `update_D-Flow`'s derived rule faithfully. Two of the three stock profiles carry
values that rule would not produce:

| Profile | soak pressure | shipped exit | rule gives | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-Flow / default | 3.0 | 1.5 | 2.1 | differs |
| D-Flow / Q | 6.0 | 3.0 | 3.6 | differs |
| D-Flow / La Pavoni | 1.2 | 1.2 | 1.2 | **matches** |

La Pavoni matching is what makes this diagnosable: a mis-transcribed rule would be wrong in all
three, not two.

Treating the profiles as intentional resolves it: the shipped exit pressures are **authored**, and
the derived rule is the fallback the editor applies when the user changes soak pressure — it has
to emit something, and half-the-soak-plus-0.6 is a reasonable something. de1app moving default's
1.5 → 2.1 on first edit is an accepted consequence of editing, not a bug in either place.

**No action, either side.** Decenza's behaviour here is correct. Kept in the suite's
known-divergent list so it does not read as an unexplained gap.

## DF-4 — `soaking(exit_pressure_over)` rewritten · Decenza defect · inert at runtime

`createInfuseFrame` sets `frame.exitPressureOver = recipe.infusePressure`. `update_D-Flow` never
writes `soaking(exit_pressure_over)`; all three stock profiles ship `3.0` regardless of soak
pressure. Decenza rewrites it — 6.0 on Q, 1.2 on La Pavoni.

**Confirmed inert at runtime**, and now for a cited reason rather than an assumption: the soak
frame carries `exit_if 0`, and `binary.tcl:955` sets `TriggerVal 0` whenever `exit_if != 1`. The
value never reaches the machine. It is still a stored difference that round-trips into files other
apps read, and "inert in today's firmware path" is not "inert".

## DF-5 — `pouring(volume)` forced to 0 · Decenza defect · **removes a cap**

`createPourFrame` sets `frame.volume = 0.0` — again `D-Flow / default`'s value. `update_D-Flow`
never writes `pouring(volume)`; Q and La Pavoni ship `100`.

This is not the same as DF-1's "cap moves". Per the firmware contract, **`0` means ignore**. So
Q and La Pavoni intend the pour frame to end at 100 mL, and Decenza sends 0 — deleting the limit
outright. On a lever-simulation profile with a 127-second pour frame, the volume cap is the
backstop; the shot is otherwise ended by weight, and a user brewing without a scale has nothing
left holding it.

Ranking this second only to DF-2 among the D-Flow findings.

---

## Root cause, common to DF-1/2/5 (and DF-4)

The plugin **mutates frames in place** — read the current `advanced_shot`, overwrite a named list
of fields, write it back — so every field outside that list survives untouched. That is the
mechanism letting one editor drive three profiles with different machine personalities.

Decenza **constructs frames from constants**, so every field outside the eight editor parameters
gets a literal. And the literals are not arbitrary: **all three are `D-Flow / default`'s values.**
The generator was written by reading one profile and generalising it. Q and La Pavoni are the two
that differ from default, and they are exactly the two that get overwritten.

One root cause, three runtime symptoms. Fixing the constants closes today's cases; adopting the
plugin's mutate-in-place shape closes the class — and is what keeps a fourth profile from
arriving with a fourth field nobody thought to preserve. That is a design decision, deliberately
left to a follow-up (design D7) rather than made inside a verification change.

**Severity order for repair:** DF-2 (imposes a 5 g fill skip that ends the fill early),
DF-5 (deletes the pour volume cap), DF-1 (relaxes the fill cap), DF-4 (stored only).

---

# A-Flow

Much worse than D-Flow, and for a different reason. D-Flow's implementation is faithful with four
wrong constants. **A-Flow has no A-Flow extraction path at all** — `RecipeAnalyzer` is a
D-Flow-shaped three-frame pattern detector, and it is being pointed at a nine-frame profile with
fixed positional roles.

`prep` never pattern-matches. It calls `set_profile_index` and reads by index. `RecipeAnalyzer`
guesses: first frame is fill, last matching frame is pour, scan the middle for ramp/infuse. On a
D-Flow profile that guess happens to land; on A-Flow it lands on the wrong frames.

**Not one of the five stock profiles survives a no-op save.**

## AF-1 — `pourFlow` read from the wrong frame · **compounds on every save**

`prep` takes pour flow from **`pouring_start(flow)`** — the Flow Start frame, index 7.
`RecipeAnalyzer` takes it from the last pour-like frame, which is **Flow Extraction**, index 8.
And `update_A-Flow` writes `pouring(flow) = pouring_flow * 2` when flow-up is on — so the
extraction frame already holds double.

Result is exactly 2× on every profile where flow-up is on:

| profile | prep | Decenza |
|---|---|---|
| default-light | 3 | 6 |
| default-medium | 2 | 4 |
| default-like-dflow | 2 | 4 |
| default-very-dark | 1.8 | 3.6 |

**This compounds.** The doubled value is written back through the same doubling rule, so the
extraction frame goes 4 → 8 on the first save, and would go 8 → 16 on the next. Two saves and the
profile is at 4× its authored flow. This is the most serious finding in the change.

## AF-2 — `flowExtractionUp` mis-derived · follows from AF-1

`prep` derives it as `pouring(flow) > Aflow_pouring_flow` — extraction flow greater than Flow
Start's. Reading both from the wrong place breaks the comparison. `default-dark` has the two
equal, so `prep` gives **false**; Decenza gives **true**, and the round-trip writes a
0 → 4 extraction flow, switching the profile from flat to ramped extraction.

## AF-3 — `rampTime` not summed across both ramp frames

`prep`: `Aflow_ramp_updown_seconds = round_to_integer(ramp_up(seconds) + ramp_down(seconds))`.
`RecipeAnalyzer` takes a single detected ramp frame's `seconds`.

| profile | ramp up + down | prep | Decenza |
|---|---|---|---|
| default-like-dflow | 0 + 0 | 0 | 5 |
| default-very-dark | 3 + 3 | 6 | 3 |

For `like-dflow` this inverts the Flow Start activation rule (`ramp_up(seconds) < 1`), so its
Flow Start frame goes from 10 s active to 0 s disabled while Pressure Up goes 0 → 5 s. The
profile's whole transition structure changes.

## AF-4 — `rampDownEnabled` is never derived · **structural loss**

`prep`: `ramp_down_enabled = ramp_down(seconds) > 0`. `RecipeAnalyzer` never sets the field at
all, so it keeps `RecipeParams`' default of `false`.

`A-Flow / default-very-dark` is *documented in the plugin readme* as "a profile with `Ramp down`
enabled", and its Pressure Decline frame carries 3 seconds. Decenza extracts `false`, and the
round-trip collapses Pressure Decline 3 s → 0 s — **deleting the phase that defines that
profile**.

This is also the finding that most directly refutes `preserve-recipe-visualizer-roundtrip`'s
premise. That change asserts the toggles "cannot be recovered from the frames". `prep` recovers
them in three lines. What cannot recover them is `RecipeAnalyzer`.

## AF-5 — `fillTimeout` read from the Pre Fill frame

`RecipeAnalyzer` hardcodes `fillIndex = 0`. In A-Flow's 9-frame layout index 0 is **Pre Fill** —
the 1-second workaround for the DE1 "skip first step" bug — and the real Fill is index 1.

So fill duration is read as 1 s instead of 15 s, and every one of the five profiles has its Fill
frame rewritten **15 s → 1 s** on save. The fill step effectively disappears.

## AF-6 — `filling(seconds)` written from `fillTimeout` · generation, not extraction

Found only by testing generation **with prep-correct parameters**, which is why §4 had to be
finished before the A-Flow picture could be called complete: with extraction broken, a round-trip
failure could originate at either end, and this one was sitting masked behind AF-5.

`prep` never reads `filling(seconds)` and `update_A-Flow` never writes it — A-Flow has no fill-time
parameter at all. Decenza's generator writes `fill.seconds = recipe.fillTimeout`, an invented
parameter, so all five profiles get **15 s → 25 s** (`RecipeParams`' default).

Read alongside AF-5, the same field takes **two different wrong values**: 25 s from generation,
1 s through the real app path where `RecipeAnalyzer` reads it off the Pre Fill frame. Both are
wrong; they are separate defects at opposite ends of the pipeline.

This is the §7 question arriving early: a Decenza-only parameter is not inert. `fillTimeout` exists
with nothing to populate it from and nothing upstream that wants it written, and its only effect is
to corrupt the Fill frame.

## What A-Flow generation gets RIGHT

Isolating generation showed its **rules are faithful**. All of these pass against the transcribed
`update_A-Flow`, across all 8 toggle combinations:

- the ramp split, including integer division and the odd remainder going to the **decline**
- `ramp_up(exit_flow_over)` — pour flow, doubled only when the decline is enabled
- `ramp_down(exit_flow_under)` — pour flow + 0.1
- Flow Start activation keyed on the **post-split** ramp-up duration, with its `pour flow − 0.1`
  threshold
- extraction flow — doubled when flow-up is on, **zero** when off
- the extraction limiter carrying pour pressure
- the soak frame taking the **fill** temperature (A-Flow's divergence from D-Flow)
- 2nd Fill / Pause at 15 s when enabled, 0 when not

So A-Flow's generator was written carefully against the plugin. The damage is almost entirely on
the **read** side, plus one invented parameter on the write side.

## Root cause

One cause, five symptoms on the read side: **Decenza reuses a D-Flow analyzer for A-Flow.** It has
no notion of `set_profile_index`, so every positional role is off by one or wrong outright, and it
derives none of the three toggles. AF-6 is separate and smaller — one invented parameter writing a
field nothing upstream owns.

Fixing the five symptoms individually would be a mistake — the correct repair is to implement
`prep` for A-Flow: resolve roles by layout, read by index, derive the toggles from structure.
That is ~20 lines and is fully specified in `reference.md`.

## Consequence for `preserve-recipe-visualizer-roundtrip`

That change's decision D1 states the recipe parameters are "not losslessly derivable from the
frames" and that frame→recipe reconstruction "cannot recover A-Flow structural toggles or the
editor type", concluding that a `recipe` block carried through Visualizer is "the only faithful
mechanism".

The evidence here says otherwise:

- **Both plugins reconstruct their full editor state from frames on every load.** That is the
  storage mechanism, not a fallback.
- **All three A-Flow toggles are recoverable** — `prep` does it from frame structure in three
  lines.
- **The editor type comes from the title prefix**, which Decenza already derives.

What was actually observed when D1 was written was `RecipeAnalyzer`'s output, which is wrong for
the reasons above. The conclusion "frames are insufficient" does not follow from "our analyzer is
wrong".

Implementing `prep` would close the Visualizer round-trip with **no schema change, no `recipe`
block, no Visualizer PR, no de1app PR and no reaprime PR** — the frames already survive Visualizer
intact. That change should be re-decided on this evidence before any more of it is built.

It also explains the fabricated built-in blocks: five identical A-Flow `recipe` blocks are what
you get from an analyzer that recovers almost nothing and falls back to defaults.

# Legacy 6-frame layout (§5)

Mostly good news, and one instructive detail.

- **The upgrade path is correct.** Editing a 6-frame profile produces 9 frames with the plugin's
  own literals for the inserted `Pre Fill`, `2nd Fill` and `Pause` — verified field by field
  against `code.tcl:295-370`, including `Pre Fill`'s temperature override at `:382`.
- **Extraction on the legacy layout has exactly one error**, and it is AF-1 again (pour flow read
  from the extraction frame). Nothing new.
- **AF-5 does not occur here.** The legacy layout has no `Pre Fill` frame for `fillIndex = 0` to
  land on, so `fillTimeout` reads the real Fill. **Decenza is accidentally more correct on the old
  layout than the new one** — exactly what you would expect from a three-frame analyzer meeting a
  six-frame profile that happens to start with Fill.

That last point is the useful one: it confirms AF-5 is specifically a 9-frame role-offset bug, not
a general misread, which narrows the fix.

# Inheritance (§6)

Verified, both directions:

- The soak parameters A-Flow inherits unchanged from D-Flow move the same frame fields in both
  editors, so a shared-half regression fails in both rather than hiding in one.
- **The documented divergence holds and is not swapped**: D-Flow's soak frame takes the **pour**
  temperature, A-Flow's takes the **fill** temperature. This is the case that motivated verifying
  both editors together — a swap round-trips cleanly on both sides and is invisible except against
  the plugins.

# Decenza-only parameters (§7) — and why §8 changes the verdict

Four parameters exist in `RecipeParams` with no plugin counterpart. Their individual behaviour:

| parameter | what it writes | plugin |
|---|---|---|
| `fillTimeout` | `filling(seconds)` | never read, never written |
| `fillPressure` | `filling(pressure)` on A-Flow; **ignored** on D-Flow (derived rule wins) | never written |
| `fillFlow` | `filling(flow)` | A-Flow's `prep` **reads** it, but `update` never writes it back |
| `infuseEnabled` | collapses `soaking(seconds)` to 0 | no such toggle |

I was going to record `infuseEnabled` as a defensible extension — collapsing a frame to 0 s is how
the plugins express "skip this step" everywhere else, so it produces a profile they read correctly.

**§8 makes that generosity moot.** `RecipeEditorPage.qml` binds exactly the plugins' parameter set
— `fillTemperature`, the four `infuse*` values, the three `pour*` values, `rampTime`, the three
A-Flow toggles, plus profile-level target weight/volume/dose. **None of the four Decenza-only
parameters appears in the QML at all.**

So they are not extensions a user opted into. They are **vestigial struct fields with a live write
path**: no control sets them, nothing reads them back meaningfully, and they still reach the frames
carrying `RecipeParams`' defaults. `fillTimeout` rewrites `filling(seconds)` to 25 s (or 1 s via
AF-5) on every save of every A-Flow profile without anyone touching anything.

**Verdict: all four are defects, not extensions.** And the repair is cheap — removing them costs no
UI, which the suite now asserts rather than assumes.

# Editor coverage (§8)

The editor itself is **correct**. It surfaces every parameter each plugin exposes and nothing more.
Combined with §4's result that generation's rules are faithful, the picture is:

> Decenza's A-Flow **editor** and **generator** are both right. The **analyzer** was never written
> for A-Flow, and four vestigial parameters leak into the frames.

# AF-7 — the app shows struct defaults, not the profile · **the finding that matters**

`tests/tst_recipeeditorapppath.cpp` drives the two `Q_INVOKABLE`s QML binds
(`getOrConvertRecipeParams` / `uploadRecipeProfile`). It contradicts the layers below it, in both
directions, and supersedes their severity estimates.

**What the editor displays for every stock A-Flow profile:**

| | fill °C | infuse s | pour °C | pour bar | pour flow | ramp s | ramp-down |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| editor shows (all five) | **88** | **20** | **93** | **9** | **2** | **5** | **off** |
| default-medium really is | 93 | 60 | 95 | 10 | 2 | 10 | off |
| default-light really is | 95 | 60 | 95 | 9.5 | 3 | 10 | off |
| default-very-dark really is | 93 | 6 | 88 | 10 | 1.8 | 6 | **on** |

Those are not analyzer misreads. **They are bare `RecipeParams` struct defaults** — 88 / 20 / 93 /
9 / 2 / 5, identical for all five.

**Mechanism, and it is not AF-1..AF-6.** `getOrConvertRecipeParams` returns the *stored* recipe
whenever `targetWeight > 0`, and never reaches `RecipeAnalyzer` at all. A `.tcl` has no recipe, so
loading one leaves `m_recipeParams` default-constructed — and `toJsonObject()` then *writes those
defaults out* as a `recipe` block, because the title says A-Flow. From then on the profile carries
a fabricated recipe that looks authoritative.

**This is the proven origin of the five identical built-in blocks** that started this whole
investigation. Previously inferred; now demonstrated end to end.

**Severity: high, and it is a display bug before it is a data bug.** A user dialling in from the
A-Flow editor is reading numbers that belong to no profile. They are misled whether or not they
ever press Save.

## What the app path clears

Measured, not assumed — and these correct earlier estimates in this document:

- **A no-op save is safe.** All five A-Flow and all three D-Flow profiles survive open-and-save
  untouched. `needFrameRegen` short-circuits when no frame-affecting field changed.
- **AF-1 does not compound through the app.** Three consecutive real edits leave extraction flow
  unchanged. The compounding shown against `RecipeGenerator` alone does not reach users.
- **D-Flow's derived fill rule works end to end.** Editing soak pressure to 6.0 correctly yields
  fill pressure 6.0 and exit-pressure-over 3.6.
- **`editorType` is repaired** from the title before the editor is populated, so the 9→3 frame
  collapse seen in the parity suite cannot happen in the app.

## What the app path confirms as real

- **Editing corrupts.** Changing pour temperature also rewrites frames 0-2 from 93 °C to 88 °C —
  because the editor's fill temperature was a default, and Save writes it. Any edit propagates the
  phantom defaults into the frames.

## Revised repair order

1. **AF-7** — stop `toJsonObject()` fabricating a recipe block for a profile that has none, and
   make `getOrConvertRecipeParams` derive from frames when no *real* recipe is stored. This is the
   one users feel, and it subsumes most of AF-1..AF-6's user-visible impact.
2. **AF-1..AF-5** — implement `prep` so the derivation in (1) is correct rather than merely present.
3. **AF-6 / §7** — delete the four vestigial parameters.
4. **DF-1/2/5** — absorbed by the #331 restore today; fix with (2) for correctness, not urgency.

# WIRE-1 — bytes on the wire, against de1app's real packer

The check that can actually speak to "does the machine do the same thing". Everything else in this
document compares Decenza's frame *model* against a transcription; this runs de1app's own
`de1_packed_shot` (`binary.tcl`) via `tools/de1app_pack_oracle.tcl` and diffs the resulting BLE
payload byte for byte. No re-implementation in the loop.

**Result across all eight stock profiles — five A-Flow, three D-Flow:**

> **Every byte is identical, except one field in the tail frame.**

Header, all nine (or three) frames, and every extension frame match exactly. That covers the whole
of the quantisation the model comparison could not see: `U8P4` setpoints, `U8P1` temperatures,
`F8_1_7` durations, `U10P0` volumes, the composed frame flags, and frame ordering.

**The one difference:**

```
line 16:  decenza[15 0904000000000000]   de1app[15 0900000000000000]
                       ^^^^                          ^^^^
```

The tail frame's `MaxTotalVolume`. Decenza encodes it with `encodeU10P0(0)`, which ORs in the
bit-10 marker → `0x0400`. de1app packs `tail(MaxTotalVolume)` through `convert_bottom_10_of_U10P0`,
which **masks** to the low ten bits → `0x0000`.

The asymmetry is de1app's own: it sets the marker on per-frame `MaxVol` — verified, frames carry
`0x0464` for a volume of 100 — and clears it on the tail. Decenza applies the frame rule to both.

**Impact: low, and bounded.** `MaxTotalVolume` is the whole-shot volume limit. de1app sends 0
("ignore"); Decenza sends 1024 with the marker bit set. If the firmware masks the low ten bits, as
its own readback helper does, the two are identical. If it does not, Decenza imposes a 1024 mL
whole-shot cap that no espresso approaches. Either way it is not a brew difference — but it is a
real byte difference, it is one line to fix, and it is exactly the class of thing that a
field-level comparison is structurally unable to find.

**What this does and does not license.** It substantiates that for these eight profiles, given
identical frames, Decenza and de1app put the same bytes on the wire. It says nothing about
profiles whose values quantise differently, and nothing about the paths that produce wrong frames
in the first place — AF-7 and AF-1..AF-6 are upstream of this and unaffected. A profile corrupted
before packing is packed faithfully wrong.

**Regenerating:** `tclsh tools/de1app_pack_oracle.tcl <de1plus-dir> <profile.tcl>`. The goldens in
`tests/data/de1app_packed/` are committed so the test runs without Tcl, and must be regenerated on
any de1app or plugin bump.

# EDIT MATRIX — 99 cases, and AF-7 is bigger than its name

Every parameter the plugins expose × every stock profile, driven through
`ProfileManager`'s `Q_INVOKABLE`s and diffed against the frames de1app's **own** `prep` +
`update_*` produce for the same edit (`tools/de1app_edit_oracle.tcl` extracts those procs
verbatim; `tools/gen_edit_matrix.py` generates the 99 goldens).

**Result: 13 of 99 match. 86 diverge.**

Clustered by first divergence:

| count | field |
|---|---|
| **55** | frame 0 (Pre Fill) temperature — A-Flow |
| **14** | frame 0 (Filling) temperature — D-Flow |
| 7 | frame 1 (Infusing) temperature |
| 5 | frame 1 (Fill) seconds |
| 5 | scattered (pressure, ramp seconds, extraction flow) |

**69 of 86 are one field: the fill frame's temperature.**

## Correction: AF-7 is not A-Flow-specific — rename it REC-1

I scoped AF-7 to A-Flow because that is where I found it. The matrix shows D-Flow is affected
identically:

> `D-Flow / La Pavoni`, editing **pour flow**:
> `frame 0 (Filling) temperature: decenza 88, de1app 84`

La Pavoni's fill is 84 °C. Decenza writes 88 — the `RecipeParams` struct default — while editing
an unrelated parameter. The mechanism is not A-Flow's: it is **any** recipe-titled profile that
arrives without a stored recipe. `toJsonObject()` fabricates a default `recipe` block because the
title says D-Flow/A-Flow; `getOrConvertRecipeParams` then returns that stored block and never
consults the frames.

So the finding is **REC-1**, covering both editors. Every A-Flow profile *and* every D-Flow
profile misreports its fill temperature, and any edit writes the wrong value into the frames.

## This also corrects my earlier D-Flow assessment

I put "edited D-Flow" at ~70% on the strength of one test —
`dflowEditingSoakPressureAppliesTheDerivedFillRule` — which passes. It passes because it asserts
only pressure fields. It never looked at temperature, and temperature is exactly what is wrong.
**Edited D-Flow is not ~70%; it is broken in the same way A-Flow is**, just less visibly, because
D-Flow's other parameters do round-trip.

That is the third time a narrower test produced a rosier answer than the wider one. The matrix is
the wide one.

## What the 13 passing cases tell us

They are the edits whose target field happens to be one the fabricated recipe block got right, on
profiles whose fill temperature happens to match the default. The pass is coincidence, not
correctness — which is why a matrix rather than a sample was necessary.

## Revised repair order

1. **REC-1** — stop fabricating a recipe block; derive from frames when none is stored. Alone this
   should collapse ~69 of the 86 divergences, across both editors.
2. **AF-1..AF-5** — implement `prep` so that derivation is right, not just present. Expect this to
   take most of the remainder.
3. **AF-6 / §7** — delete the four vestigial parameters (fixes the `Fill seconds` cluster).
4. **WIRE-1**, **DF-1/2/5** — one-liners, no urgency.

The matrix is the acceptance gate: after (1) and (2), it should go from 13/99 to near 99/99, and
any residue is a real remaining defect rather than an unknown.

# Status

All verification sections complete (§1–§13). Full suite green throughout.

**Every finding is now repaired**, in `derive-recipe-params-from-frames`. Dispositions below;
the analysis above is left exactly as it was written, including the predictions that turned out
wrong, because how the picture changed is part of the record.

# Disposition

| Finding | Outcome | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **REC-1** | Repaired | `Profile::hasRecipeParams()` gates the recipe-block write on evidence, not on the title. `getOrConvertRecipeParams` reaches the frame-derived path whenever no genuine block exists. |
| **AF-1** pourFlow from the wrong frame | Repaired | `RecipeAnalyzer::prepAFlow` — pour flow from `Flow Start`, per `code.tcl:210`. |
| **AF-2** flowExtractionUp mis-derived | Repaired | derived from `pouring(flow) > pourFlow`, against the *rounded* value as the plugin does. |
| **AF-3** rampTime not summed | Repaired | sum of both ramp frames, rounded to an integer. |
| **AF-4** rampDownEnabled never derived | Repaired | `rampDown.seconds > 0`. `default-very-dark` now extracts `true`, matching the plugin readme. |
| **AF-5** fillTimeout from Pre Fill | Repaired | the parameter is gone (see AF-6). |
| **AF-6** filling(seconds) from fillTimeout | Repaired | the four vestigial parameters removed; `Profile::restoreFieldsThePluginNeverWrites` preserves the frame fields they used to trample. |
| **DF-1** filling(volume) forced to 100 | Repaired | same role-based restore. |
| **DF-2** filling(weight) forced to 5 g | Repaired | same. This was the shot-affecting one — a 5 g app-side exit imposed on a fill step whose author asked for none. |
| **DF-3** filling(exit_pressure_over) recomputed | **Not a defect — retained** | `update_D-Flow` genuinely derives this field, and de1app rewrites it identically on the user's first edit. Matching it *is* parity. Allowed by name in the round-trip assertions, with La Pavoni pinned as an exact fixed point so the allowance cannot mask a drifting rule. |
| **DF-4** soaking(exit_pressure_over) rewritten | Repaired | same role-based restore. Was inert at runtime (`exit_if 0`); fixed for consistency, not for the shot. |
| **DF-5** pouring(volume) forced to 0 | Repaired | same. Removed a stop cap rather than moving one, since the firmware reads `MaxVol 0` as "ignore". |
| **WIRE-1** tail MaxTotalVolume marker | Repaired | the tail sends a bare `0x0000`. **Reassessed as non-cosmetic**: de1app's own comment on that field is "Unused. Use highest bit to enable / disable preinfusion tracking", so Decenza was asserting a firmware flag on every profile that de1app never sets. |

## Corrections this effort forced on its own analysis

Recorded because the pattern — a narrower test giving a rosier answer — recurred at every layer.

1. **"Edited D-Flow is ~70% right"** — withdrawn. It rested on a test that asserts pressure
   fields and never reads temperature, which is what was wrong. The matrix put D-Flow in the same
   condition as A-Flow.
2. **AF-7 renamed REC-1** — it was never A-Flow-specific. `D-Flow / La Pavoni` writes fill 88 °C
   where the profile says 84 °C while editing an unrelated parameter.
3. **"REC-1 should clear ~69 of 86 rows"** — it cleared 11. Fill temperature was merely *first* in
   each row, not the only divergence in it. This is why the gate now counts differing *fields* as
   well as rows.
4. **"The four vestigial parameters have no surface"** — §8 checked QML only. All four were
   exposed by `profiles_get_params` and `profiles_edit_params`, so an AI could set them.
5. **DF-1/DF-2/DF-5 as generator bugs** — they were a missing preservation step. The constants
   (100 / 5.0 / 0) are `D-Flow / default`'s own values: right for a profile created from scratch,
   wrong for every existing one. Testing `generateFrames` in isolation measured a component the
   app never calls alone.
6. **WIRE-1 as "a one-liner, no urgency"** — it was reading the byte as padding. It is a flag.

## Final gate

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| Edit matrix, single edit | 0 divergences / 0 differing fields, 99 cases |
| Edit matrix, two successive saves | 8 / 8 profiles match |
| Packed bytes vs de1app's real packer | 89 / 89 stock profiles, nothing excluded |
| Packed bytes, quantisation-boundary corpus | 120 / 120, nothing excluded |
| Round-trip fixed point | all 8 stock profiles (DF-3 excepted by name) |
| Expected-failures remaining | none |
