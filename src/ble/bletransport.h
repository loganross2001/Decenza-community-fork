/**
 * BLE transport for DE1 communication.
 *
 * Implements DE1Transport using QLowEnergyController (Bluetooth Low Energy).
 * Handles service discovery, characteristic subscriptions, write retries, and
 * the DE1's half of the process-wide GATT queue.
 *
 * Every GATT operation this class issues — writes, reads, and the CCCD writes
 * that enable notifications — goes through BleGattQueue, which is shared with
 * the scale and refractometer transports. Nothing here dispatches to the
 * platform while any device has an operation outstanding. See blegattqueue.h
 * for why that is process-wide rather than per-device (#1819).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. Construct BleTransport
 *   2. Call connectToDevice(deviceInfo)
 *   3. BleTransport handles service discovery, subscribes to notifications,
 *      reads initial values, and requests Idle state
 *   4. Emits connected() when ready for I/O (isConnected() returns false until
 *      characteristic discovery completes, even if the BLE link is up)
 *   5. Call disconnect() or delete to tear down

    // Was 10. Measured across 283 retry cycles in the 26-log user-submitted
    // corpus (#1176 … #1810). 12 of those logs carry a "retrying 1/10" line; 14
    // carry at least one exhaustion, and the two extra are head-trimmed captures
    // whose opening retry lines are not present — which is also where the four
    // unattributed exhaustions below come from. Both counts are real; they count
    // different things.
    // Cycles are counted by their "retrying 1/10" line and their outcome by the
    // highest retry they reached:
    //
    //     retries needed   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   ran out
    //     cycles          10   2   3   1   1   2   1   2   1       260
    //
    // So 23 cycles recovered and 260 — 92% of all retry activity — ran the full
    // budget and failed. (264 exhaustion lines were logged; the extra four are
    // head-trimmed sessions whose "retrying 1/10" is not in the capture. No
    // cycle is observed to recover at retry 10.)
    //
    // The budget is also a TIME bound, and that is what actually broke: at 10
    // retries a timing-out write occupies the link for
    //   11 × WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS + 10 × WRITE_RETRY_DELAY_MS = 60.0 s
    // which is not shorter than the 60 s MMR keepalive period — so on a degraded
    // link the next keepalive is queued before the previous one is abandoned and
    // the link never goes idle (measured dispatch→abandonment in #1691: 60.06 s,
    // with keepalive exhaustions exactly 60.0 s apart). At 5 the worst case is
    //   6 × 5000 + 5 × 500 = 32.5 s
    // leaving the link idle before the next periodic write.
    //
    // 5 rather than 3 (both are in range) retains 17 of the 23 observed
    // recoveries against 15 at 3 — two cycles out of 283, for 11 s more
    // worst-case latency that still clears the keepalive period. That is a
    // narrow margin and the honest reading is that either value is defensible;
    // 5 is the more conservative of the two. Flat, NOT scaled by recent failure
    // history: at 260/283 cycles the failing-link case already dominates, so a
    // graduated budget would buy under a second and cost a second concept.
    //
    // How to re-derive, since the point of the paragraph below is that these
    // numbers must be reproducible: over the extracted corpus, count
    // "retrying 1/10" lines for cycles started, per-N "retrying N/10" line
    // counts for the distribution (recoveries at exactly N = count(N) -
    // count(N+1)), and "FAILED after 10 retries" for exhaustions. Every
    // exhaustion path shared one counter and emitted the same "retrying N/10"
    // text, so a cycle could start on one and end on another; they are
    // deliberately counted together.
    //
    // Those are the marker strings in the CORPUS, which is fixed and predates
    // the shared queue. In logs captured since, both markers moved: retries are
    // counted by BleGattQueue and logged by it as
    // "[Bluetooth][GattQueue] retry N/5 for <verb> <uuid>", and exhaustion is
    // this transport's own "Write FAILED after 5 retries" (bletransport.cpp,
    // the onAbandoned callback). Grep for that pair instead. The counting rule
    // is unchanged — one counter, every failure path.
    //
    // These figures replace an earlier set (434 cycles, 380 exhaustions, "43 of
    // 54 recoveries at a budget of 5") that were stated here as measurement and
    // did not survive re-derivation from the corpus. The QUALITATIVE conclusion
    // was unchanged — if anything the true share running the full budget is
    // higher — but the counts were not reproducible, so they are recorded here
    // as having been wrong rather than quietly swapped.
