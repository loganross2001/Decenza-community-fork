## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: No recipe block is written

A profile Decenza serializes SHALL NOT contain a `recipe` key. Editor parameters for D-Flow and
A-Flow profiles are reconstructed from the frames on every read, so persisting them stores a copy
that no reader consults and that drifts from the frames it duplicates.

`recipe` SHALL remain listed as a key the serializer models. That list is the unknown-key
passthrough's exclusion list, so a listed key is dropped while an unlisted one is captured and
re-emitted verbatim — removing the entry would preserve every stale block permanently, the
opposite of the intent.

#### Scenario: A serialized profile carries no block

- **WHEN** any profile is serialized, exported, shared, or uploaded to Visualizer
- **THEN** the emitted JSON contains no `recipe` key

#### Scenario: An existing block is not echoed back

- **WHEN** a profile file that still contains a `recipe` block is loaded and saved
- **THEN** the saved file contains no `recipe` key
- **AND** the block is not preserved by the unknown-key passthrough

#### Scenario: Frames and BLE output are unaffected

- **WHEN** a D-Flow or A-Flow profile is loaded and uploaded to the machine, with and without a
  stored block
- **THEN** the BLE header and every frame are byte-identical in both cases

#### Scenario: A simple profile loses its block without changing

- **WHEN** a `settings_2a` or `settings_2b` profile carrying a block is loaded and saved
- **THEN** the block is gone and every scalar, along with the frames generated from those
  scalars, is unchanged

### Requirement: A stored block is removed on sight

Encountering a profile that still carries a `recipe` block SHALL remove it and persist the
removal, so that no profile retains a block once this change has shipped. The one-time upgrade
covers what is already stored; this covers everything that arrives afterwards — an import, a
share code, a device-to-device sync, a restored backup.

Removing the block in memory alone is NOT sufficient: a profile the user never re-saves would
keep its block on disk indefinitely.

Where the profile cannot be written — a bundled resource, a read-only store — the block SHALL
still be absent from everything the profile produces, and the failure to persist SHALL NOT
prevent the profile from loading.

#### Scenario: A profile imported after the upgrade is stripped

- **WHEN** a profile carrying a block is imported, received as a share code, or synced from
  another device, and then loaded
- **THEN** the block is removed and the stripped profile is written back once
- **AND** loading it again performs no further write

#### Scenario: The write-back is not blocked by the parity gate

- **WHEN** the stripped profile is checked for lossless conversion before being persisted
- **THEN** the removal of `recipe` is not reported as a lost key
- **AND** the write proceeds

#### Scenario: An unwritable profile still loads

- **WHEN** a profile carrying a block cannot be written back
- **THEN** it loads with no block in memory and the failure is reported rather than raised

### Requirement: Removing the block is not a parity loss

The lossless-conversion check that guards stored-encoding upgrade, the `espresso_temperature`
repair, legacy format migration and the profile-sync audit SHALL treat the removal of `recipe` as
deliberate rather than as a lost key.

A structured value is otherwise never inert, so without this the check reports `recipe: KEY LOST`
for any profile still carrying one — permanently disabling those repairs for exactly the profiles
that most need them.

#### Scenario: A profile with a block is still eligible for repair

- **WHEN** a profile carrying a block is checked for lossless conversion against its stripped form
- **THEN** no error is reported
- **AND** stored-encoding upgrade, temperature repair and legacy format migration all proceed

#### Scenario: Other lost keys are still reported

- **WHEN** a conversion drops any key other than `recipe`
- **THEN** that key is still reported as lost

### Requirement: A set dose survives as a recommended dose

`recipe.dose` is the only value in the block that is not reconstructed from the frames or
duplicated by a top-level key. Where a profile carries a dose that differs from the default and
has no explicit recommendation of its own, that value SHALL be preserved as `recommended_dose`,
with `has_recommended_dose` set.

A profile that already carries an explicit recommendation SHALL keep it — the block SHALL NOT
overwrite a value the user set through the editor.

#### Scenario: A user-set dose is promoted

- **WHEN** a profile carrying `recipe.dose` different from the default is read, and the profile
  has no explicit recommended dose
- **THEN** `recommended_dose` takes the block's dose
- **AND** `has_recommended_dose` is set

#### Scenario: A default dose is not promoted

- **WHEN** a profile carrying the default `recipe.dose` is read
- **THEN** no recommendation is enabled on that profile

#### Scenario: An explicit recommendation wins

- **WHEN** a profile carries both an explicit recommended dose and a block dose
- **THEN** the explicit recommended dose is kept unchanged

### Requirement: A dose reported to a caller carries its enabled flag

Where a recommended dose is reported to an external caller, the flag saying whether it is a real
recommendation SHALL be reported with it.

Every profile holds a dose value whether or not one was set — the default is 18 g — so a bare
figure would tell a caller there is a recommendation when there is not.

#### Scenario: Reading a profile with no recommendation

- **WHEN** the parameters of a profile with `has_recommended_dose` unset are requested
- **THEN** the response states that no recommendation is enabled

#### Scenario: Setting a dose through the parameter surface

- **WHEN** a caller sets a dose through the profile parameter surface
- **THEN** the profile's recommended dose takes that value and its recommendation is enabled
- **AND** the field is not reported back as unrecognised or ignored

### Requirement: A one-time upgrade brings saved profiles to the new shape

A one-time pass SHALL rewrite already-saved profiles in the user, downloaded and SAF stores to
remove the `recipe` key, promoting a set dose by the rule above. The pass SHALL run once and
SHALL report what it changed and what it skipped.

It SHALL NOT rewrite a profile whose conversion would lose anything other than the block, and it
SHALL run in an order that does not defeat the lossless-conversion gate protecting legacy profile
migration.

#### Scenario: Saved profiles lose their blocks

- **WHEN** the upgrade runs over a store containing profiles with recipe blocks
- **THEN** each profile is rewritten without a `recipe` key
- **AND** each profile's frames, targets and every other key are unchanged

#### Scenario: The upgrade runs once

- **WHEN** the upgrade has already completed
- **THEN** a subsequent start does not rewrite profiles again

#### Scenario: A legacy profile is not rewritten unaudited

- **WHEN** the store holds a legacy-format profile carrying a block
- **THEN** it is converted once through the audited path, not rewritten twice by two passes

#### Scenario: A failed write does not lose a profile

- **WHEN** rewriting a profile fails
- **THEN** the original file is left intact and the failure is reported
