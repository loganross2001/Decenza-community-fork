    // false SAW stop. Any reading that jumps more than 100g from the previous
    // sample is rejected. Auto-resets after 3 consecutive rejections to handle
    // legitimate shifts (cup removal, scale reconnect at different offset). The tare
    // used to rely on that hatch too; it is handled up front now — see below.
    //
    // Only active during extraction — between shots, cup placement/removal,
    // tare drift, and scale reconnect at different offset produce legitimate
    // 100g+ swings that the filter would reject, freezing the flow rate display
    // and polluting the debug log. The filter is reset by startExtraction()
    // before each shot and by resetForRetare() on mid-preheat retare.
    //
    // ONE step is exempt: the tare. startExtraction() clears the baseline, but the tare
    // is asynchronous AT THE SCALE — the samples arriving just after it still carry the
    // loaded portafilter's weight, and one of them becomes the new baseline. The drop to
    // zero that follows then reads as a >100 g spike, so the filter rejected the app's
    // own tare. Observed every shot on-device: "Spike rejected: weight= 0 last= 364.6"
    // twice, then the 3-rejection escape hatch accepting the baseline it should never
    // have questioned.
    //
    // The exemption is deliberately DIRECTIONAL: only a large step DOWN to near zero,
    // and only while awaiting a tare. Corruption of the #610 kind travels upward (1649 g
    // instead of 10 g), so nothing about that case needs the filter relaxed — and an
    // exemption for large steps in general would leave a window with no filter at all,
    // whose end depended on events that might never arrive (a scale that never reads
    // near zero, a shot where flow never starts). Every sample the SPIKE FILTER sees
    // other than the tare step is therefore filtered exactly as before.
    //
    // The m_awaitingTare window is not gone, though — it still gates the per-frame
    // weight exit at the bottom of this function, and on an untared cup that never
    // reads near zero in a shot where flow never starts, that gate stays shut for the
