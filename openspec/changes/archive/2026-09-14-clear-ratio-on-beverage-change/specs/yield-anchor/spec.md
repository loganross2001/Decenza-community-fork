## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A ratio anchor survives a profile change; an absolute one does not

When a profile is loaded, the system SHALL clear a session anchor whose mode is `absolute` (a gram target describes the profile it was set against). It SHALL preserve one whose mode is `ratio` when the new profile's beverage group matches the previous profile's, and SHALL clear it when the group changes. The groups are espresso (including an empty or unrecognised `beverage_type`), filter (`filter`, `pourover`) and tea (`tea`, `tea_portafilter`), compared trimmed and case-insensitively. A maintenance profile (`cleaning`, `descale`, `calibrate`) SHALL neither use nor clear any brew override and SHALL NOT count as a group change: its own target and temperatures apply. Reloading the drink profile loaded before a maintenance run SHALL keep every brew override.

When the load leaves no anchor, the system SHALL arm the active recipe's saved yield, else the active bag's, except on a maintenance profile. A recipe's gram yield equal to the profile's own `target_weight` SHALL NOT be armed. A ratio the user sets after the load SHALL apply normally.

#### Scenario: Ratio persists across a profile switch
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{2.0, ratio}` and the user loads a different espresso profile
- **THEN** the anchor remains `{2.0, ratio}` and the target re-derives against the current dose

#### Scenario: Absolute clears on a profile switch
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{40.0, absolute}`, neither an active recipe nor the active bag saves a yield, and the user loads a different profile
- **THEN** the anchor clears and the new profile's `target_weight` applies

#### Scenario: Ratio clears when the beverage group changes
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{2.5, ratio}`, neither an active recipe nor the active bag saves a yield, and the user loads a profile whose `beverage_type` is `tea_portafilter`
- **THEN** the anchor clears and the tea profile's own `target_weight` applies (0 = no weight stop)

#### Scenario: Espresso to filter drops the espresso ratio
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{2.0, ratio}` from an espresso profile and the user loads a `pourover` profile
- **THEN** the dialed ratio is cleared

#### Scenario: The bean's saved yield applies after the switch
- **WHEN** the active bag saves `{300.0, absolute}`, no recipe is active, and the user switches from an espresso profile to a filter profile
- **THEN** the anchor is `{300.0, absolute}`

#### Scenario: A recipe's saved yield outranks the bean's
- **WHEN** the active recipe saves `{2.2, ratio}`, its bag saves `{2.0, ratio}`, and a load leaves no anchor
- **THEN** the anchor is `{2.2, ratio}`

#### Scenario: A ratio dialed after the load applies
- **WHEN** a tea profile is loaded, the dose is 18 g, and the user then sets the anchor `{2.5, ratio}`
- **THEN** the target resolves to 45 g

#### Scenario: A cleaning run neither uses nor clears the ratio
- **WHEN** the session anchor is `{3.0, ratio}` on a filter profile and the user loads a cleaning profile, then a filter profile
- **THEN** the cleaning run stops on its own `target_weight`, and the filter profile's target resolves from `{3.0, ratio}` again

#### Scenario: Replaying a shot with no yield override
- **WHEN** a shot pulled at its profile's own target is loaded from history while the active bag saves a ratio
- **THEN** the session has no yield anchor and the profile's `target_weight` applies
