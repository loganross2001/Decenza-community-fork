     * and the /api/backup/restore endpoint — and the copies were identical
     * only by luck. Adding the shotId remap below to one and not the others
     * was the obvious next failure, which is why they were collapsed before
     * it was added.
     *
     * `shotIdMap` maps SOURCE shot ids to the ids those shots received in
     * THIS device's database, as produced by
     * ShotHistoryStorage::importDatabaseStatic. Each turn's `shotId` is
     * rewritten through it. A source id the map does not contain has its
     * `shotId` REMOVED, leaving the turn in the documented null state (no
     * key) rather than holding an id that names a foreign database.
     *
     * Passing nullptr means "no shots came with these conversations" — the
     * conversations-only import path — and clears every `shotId`. That is
     * the same rule, not an exception to it: an absent map is the degenerate
     * case of an absent entry. Keeping the ids there would leave every turn
     * pointing into a database this device does not have.
     *
     * DO NOT call this at all when the shot import was REFUSED
     * (ShotHistoryStorage::ImportResult::refused()). A refusal is provoked by a transient
     * condition — a mid-scan SQLITE_BUSY — so the user's natural response is
     * to run the restore again. Importing the conversations now with every id
     * cleared makes that retry useless: the keys are already present, the
     * retry skips them as duplicates, and the linkage is gone permanently.
     * Import nothing and let the retry do it properly.
     *
     * Callers keep their own policy: replace-mode pre-clearing, sync(), and
     * reloading the live conversation all stay with the caller.
     *
     * `equipmentIdMap` is the same shape for equipment packages, from
     * ShotHistoryStorage::ImportResult::equipmentIdMap. It is needed because the
     * conversation KEY is derived from the package id: the incoming key names a
     * package row in the SOURCE database, and importing under it produces a
     * thread no shot on this device can open — or worse, one that collides with
     * a destination package that happens to share the source's row id.
     *
     * So each conversation is RE-KEYED through the map before it is written,
     * and two shapes are refused rather than imported wrong:
     *   - a conversation whose carried key is not what these fields derive
     *     (an archive written before the key included the package), because
     *     there is no shot on this device that would ever open it;
     *   - a conversation naming a package the map does not contain, because
     *     bucket 0 would put a thread about one basket into the unpackaged
     *     pool, which is the contamination the key exists to prevent.
     * Both are counted on ImportTally (`refusedNeedShots` / `refusedLegacyKey`)
     * and rendered by `importRefusalNote`. They were briefly log-only, on the
     * reasoning that no caller had anywhere to show them — which was wrong:
     * every caller already reports `conversationsImported` to the user, so the
     * survivors were shown and the casualties were not.
