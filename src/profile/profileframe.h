/**
 * ProfileFrame represents a single step/frame in an espresso profile.
 *
 * This structure captures ALL possible frame parameters from the DE1 BLE protocol
 * and de1app profile format, enabling both:
 * - Frame-based profiles (uploaded to machine, executed autonomously)
 * - Direct Setpoint Control (app sends live setpoints during extraction)
 *
 * DE1 BLE Frame Wire Format (8 bytes):
 *   FrameToWrite (1), Flag (1), SetVal (U8P4, 1), Temp (U8P1, 1),
 *   FrameLen (F8_1_7, 1), TriggerVal (U8P4, 1), MaxVol (U10P0, 2)
 *
 * Extension Frame (for limiters, +32 to frame number):
 *   FrameToWrite (1), MaxFlowOrPressure (U8P4, 1), Range (U8P4, 1), [padding]

    // assigns must keep the value the profile's author gave it. It works from a
    // hand-maintained list of fields — so a field added here and not mentioned
    // there is silently never restored, for every frame role, permanently. That
    // is exactly findings DF-1, DF-2, DF-5 and AF-6, which is what the function
    // exists to close. Nothing will warn you; the compiler is happy either way.

    // we do not model is usually an app's own metadata block — our `recipe` is

    // nothing because it does not touch the shot. A key inside a STEP is
    // different: steps are what the machine executes. If a future app version
    // adds, say, a new exit condition or pump mode to a frame, round-tripping the
    // key verbatim would NOT save us — we would still ignore it while brewing and
    // silently pour a different shot than the file describes.
    //
    // So an unrecognised step key means we cannot promise the same coffee, and
    // the honest response is to refuse the profile and say which key we did not
    // understand, so it gets reported rather than quietly mis-brewed.
