// QML registration for Settings, kept OUT of settings.h on purpose.
//
// settings.h sits at the base of a wide include graph, and some of its consumers do not link
// Qt::Qml at all — `saw_parity` compiles settings.cpp against Core/Sql/Network/Gui/Bluetooth
// only (CMakeLists.txt), so a <QtQml/...> include in that header is a build break, not a style
// question.
//
// QML_FOREIGN exists for exactly this: annotate the type from somewhere else. Only the Decenza
// target compiles this file, so the QtQml dependency stops here.
//
// Why a singleton at all: `Settings` was a context property, and a context property is invisible
// to qmllint — it cannot resolve the name, so every one of the ~1,300 `Settings.<domain>.<prop>`
// references in QML counted as an unqualified-access warning. A compile-time registration puts
// the type in the module's generated Decenza.qmltypes, which is the only place qmllint learns
// about C++ types.
//
// NOTE: registering the type is necessary but NOT sufficient — main.cpp must also call
// qml_register_types_Decenza() explicitly, or none of this module's declarative types reach the
// runtime registry. See the comment at that call site; it is a Qt guard that this app trips.

#include <QtQml/qqmlregistration.h>

// Brings Settings and, through it, all twelve domain classes — QML_FOREIGN needs each of them
// complete, and settings.h now declares its properties with those concrete types anyway.

// The twelve domain sub-objects. Each is reachable only as `Settings.<domain>`, never
// constructed from QML — the same contract the runtime qmlRegisterUncreatableType<> calls in
// main.cpp used to express, moved to compile time and keeping the identical QML type names.
//
// Compile-time registration is what makes the difference for tooling: a runtime call is
// invisible to qmltyperegistrar, so qmllint could not resolve these types and reported every
// `Settings.<domain>.<prop>` as a missing property (measured: 1,079 of them). Registered here,
// the whole Settings tree is checkable, so a typo like `Settings.brew.slectedFlushPreset` is
// caught by the linter instead of silently evaluating to undefined at runtime.
// Written out one by one rather than generated from a macro: moc does not expand macros that
// declare a class containing Q_GADGET/Q_OBJECT, so a macro here compiles but registers nothing
// — the exact silent-success failure this change exists to eliminate.
