## 1. Narrow the advertised set

- [x] 1.1 Remove `2024-11-05` and `2025-03-26` from `supportedProtocolVersions()`. Leaves `2025-11-25` (preferred, first) and `2025-06-18`
- [x] 1.2 Do NOT remove `2025-06-18`. `codex-mcp-client` negotiates it — the one drop with a known victim. The reason is a measurement, not a guess; see design.md
- [x] 1.3 Test: a client requesting a dropped revision is answered with the preferred version, which is the existing unsupported-version behaviour and needs no new code

## 2. Delete batch dispatch

- [x] 2.1 Delete `handleJsonRpcBatch` (136 lines) and `willDeferResponse` (13), and their declarations
- [x] 2.2 Replace the `doc.isArray()` branch in `handleHttpRequest` with an explicit JSON-RPC error naming batching as unsupported. Do not silently ignore an array — a client that sends one deserves to be told, and a 202 or a parse error would both mislead
- [x] 2.3 Remove the batch coverage in `tst_mcpserver_protocol.cpp` (36 references). Replace with ONE test that an array body is refused with an error rather than processed
- [x] 2.4 Check nothing else calls either function before deleting — `willDeferResponse` exists only for the batch path, but confirm rather than assume

## 3. Collapse the gates whose old arm is unreachable

- [x] 3.1 `instructions` in `handleInitialize`: drop the `>= 2025-03-26` gate, keep the field
- [x] 3.2 `emitTitle` in `McpToolRegistry::listTools` and `McpResourceRegistry::listResources`: drop the `>= 2025-06-18` gate, always emit `title`
- [x] 3.3 Leave `structuredContent` / `resource_link` (2025-06-18) and `$schema` dialect / `icons` (2025-11-25) gated. Both surviving revisions are still distinguishable by them
- [x] 3.4 Move the version-floor constants to `2025-06-18`: `PendingConfirmation::protocolVersion`, the `effectiveProtocolVersion` fallback, and `McpSession::m_protocolVersion`
- [x] 3.5 Fix the always-emitted text block's comment. It claims to exist for "2024-11-05 / 2025-03-26 clients", which was never why: `content[]` is required on a tool result at every revision and `structuredContent` is additive. Left as-is it reads as a licence to delete the block

## 4. Record the deviation

- [x] 4.1 The protocol says assume `2025-03-26` when the header is absent. We cannot assume a version we refuse, so the floor becomes `2025-06-18`. Write that at the site as a knowing deviation from a SHOULD, with the reason it is the safe direction — the floor emits strictly fewer optional fields
- [x] 4.2 **`2025-03-26` stays accepted as a HEADER value** while not being negotiable. It is the protocol's compatibility sentinel — the value a client sends when it cannot identify the version — so it conveys no version request and is treated as an absent header. Dropping it from the negotiable set without this turned the ecosystem's own fallback into a 400, which the conformance suite caught immediately. Accepting the header does NOT grant that revision's semantics: batching in particular is gone regardless
- [x] 4.3 `docs/CLAUDE_MD/MCP_SERVER.md`: the supported set, the sentinel, and that batching is gone

## 5. Verify

- [x] 5.1 `mcp__qtcreator__run_tests` — ask first, Qt Creator is shared. Named scope is enough for the MCP tests; a full run before the PR
- [x] 5.2 Conformance against a running app with the checked-in baseline: **exit 0**, 9 passed, 22 expected failures, no stale entries, scenario-by-scenario identical to the pre-drop run. The suite has no scenarios for either dropped revision, so it cannot confirm the removal either way — what it confirms is that nothing else regressed. New log lines verified live on the built binary, not only under test
- [ ] 5.3 **NOT DONE — carried forward.** ShotServer's route is verified (conformance exit 0, plus live checks of negotiation, the sentinel and the batch refusal). `McpRemoteAccess` is a second entry into the same handler and was NOT exercised; it needs the tokenized URL. This change does not touch routing, so the risk is low, but "low" is not "checked" and the PR says so rather than implying coverage it does not have
- [x] 5.4 No wiki manual change — protocol revisions are not a user-visible app surface
- [x] 5.5 Open the PR, then run `/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`
- [x] 5.6 Archive + spec sync as the final commit on the same PR

## 6. Sequencing note

- [→] 6.1 **For the NEXT change, not this one.** This lands BEFORE `add-mcp-dual-era-2026`, and both modify the `MCP-Protocol-Version Request Header` requirement — this one changes the header-absent assumption, that one changes the mismatch rule. Whichever lands second rebases and merges both edits into one requirement block. Flagged here so the collision is expected rather than discovered
- [x] 6.2 `McpSurfaceVersion` does NOT need bumping. It tracks the TOOL surface, which is unchanged; `scripts/check_mcp_tool_budget.py` fingerprints tools and actions, not protocol revisions
